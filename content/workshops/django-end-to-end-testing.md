summary: |
  This tutorial provides hands-on experience with end-to-end testing for Django
  using pytest and Playwright. Participants acquire solid strategies to test
  common patterns in Django applications and the experience of writing a
  complete test suite for a non-trivial application.
---

A comprehensive test suite gives you the confidence to fix bugs, refactor, and
add new features to your application without fear of unknowingly breaking
unrelated parts of the codebase. End-to-end tests are a useful and important
member of your testing toolbox, and tools like [pytest](https://pytest.org) and
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) provide a robust implementation for Python
developers.

The tutorial runs for 180 minutes and is completely hands-on. It covers the
following topics with practical exercises that each participant completes on
their own computer:

- "User contract" testing
- Pytest and custom fixtures
- Asserting DOM state
- Testing interactive elements
- Integrating your test suite with Continuous Integration (CI)

## Comments From Attendees

> I liked that it was hands-on, started with basics, and had failing tests as
> part of the tutorial. Seeing progression from failure to passing is really
> helpful for understanding what is happening in the code.

> Though I am not new to testing, these techniques are new and super helpful.
> Iâ€™m hoping to bring this all to my team.

> I liked how interactive it was. The whole tutorial was easy enough to follow,
> but explained some advanced concepts along the way. Being able to write,
> update, and run tests multiple times during the workshop was very helpful.
