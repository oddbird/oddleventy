Like all web languages,
**Cascading Style Sheets have come a long way
since their early inception** --
providing powerful and dynamic tools
for cross-browser and cross-device interface design.

Miriam will introduce a variety of new and advanced CSS techniques,
along with practical use-cases, integrations, and pitfalls.
You’ll learn how to manage CSS variables, grids, calculations,
support queries, and more --
but understanding the syntax is only a start.
We’ll talk about building a robust code architecture
with CSS-driven design systems,
passing data between JS and CSS,
and combining modern techniques to solve real,
everyday interface problems.
