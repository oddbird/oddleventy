<h2>Hi, I'm Miriam</h2>

I co-founded OddBird with my brothers in 2008
to provide **custom web application design and development**,
along with refactors for **integrated design systems,
accessibility, performance,
and long-term sustainability**.

Since then OddBird has become an industry leader --
from our work on Django, Sass, and Susy,
to the Mozilla Developer Channel,
**CSS Working Group**,
and in-depth **conference talks on front-end architecture, workflow,
component libraries, testing, and documentation**.

We'd love to help you
take your app to the next level.
