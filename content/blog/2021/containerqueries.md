summary: |
  The `@container` query, that elusive feature developers have been requesting
  and proposing for years, has finally made its debut in a browser. Well, sort
  of. Here we'll explain what container queries are, how they work, and what
  other features they might come with once fully supported in browsers.

{% callout 'note', update %}
  ðŸ¥³Container queries have been available to use in all major browsers since
  February 2023. We've updated the guide with changes and developments that have happened since we first published.

- New [containment types] have been added and other implied or planned containment behavior has been adjusted or removed.
- Some [features that were being considered] have landed in browsers, while some are only partially implemented.

{% endcallout %}

In the latest version of [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/),
the most recent `@container` query proposal is available for use behind an
experimental flag. Developed by OddBird's own [Miriam
Suzanne](https://www.oddbird.net/authors/miriam/), the
[draft](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5796) builds upon the ideas
previously proposed by other web standards experts like David Baron, who wrote
the [original
draft](https://github.com/dbaron/container-queries-implementability).

## Background

`@Media` queries sparked a responsive design revolution by allowing authors to
change the style of elements based on the size of the entire viewport. Up until
now, what could not be done was changing the style of an element based on the
size of one of its nearest containers.

## Syntax and an example

The proposed `@container` query syntax feels a lot like writing a `@media`
query, but a main difference is that a `@container` query has to be implemented
in two parts.

In this demo (which only works in the latest version of [Chrome
Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/)), a `blockquote` is styled
differently depending on the size of its container.

{{ embed.codepen(
  id='YzpywrZ',
  title='Container Queries with Block Quotes',
  user='dvdherron',
  height=600
) }}

### Define a containment context

To achieve this, first define a containment context. This lets the browser know
which container to query against later and how exactly to query that specific
container.

```scss
article,
section {
  container-type: inline-size;
}
```

The `container-type`^[_Syntax for establishing a containment context was updated
**July 14, 2021** to use the new `container-type` and `container-name`
properties instead of `contain`._] property turns on containment for the
selected elements, allowing for the testing of aspects such as style, size, and
state.

The `inline-size` value specifies that, in this case, queries will be made
against the containing element's [inline
axis](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-writing-modes-4/#inline-axis).
[`Layout`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-contain/#valdef-contain-layout) and
[`size`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-contain/#size-containment)^[_A previous
version of this article listed `style` and `layout` as required values for the
`contain` property when establishing a containment context. These values are now
automatically applied when using the new `container-type` and `container-name`
properties. Updated **July 14, 2021**_.] containment are applied automatically
as well.

(`Block-size` is also being considered as a containment type in the new
proposal. `Inline-size` seemed to satisfy more use-cases, so is being developed
first.)

{% callout 'note', update %}

- `Inline-size` containment has been well-supported since container queries were supported in stable versions of browsers.
- `Layout` containment was previously applied automatically when `container-type` and `container-name` properties were used. It has since been removed from the container queries specification, but is still applied in some browsers that have not updated their implementation of container queries.
- Single-axis `block-size` containment proved to be impossible and has since been abandoned.
- The `size` containment type, which queries in both the inline and
block axes, has been available as a containment type in all browsers since
February 2023. Setting `container-type: size` allows for querying the container's
orientation and aspect-ratio in addition to its size.

{% endcallout %}

Containers can also be named:

```scss
article,
section {
  container-name: demo;
  container-type: inline-size;
}
```

And the `container-type` and `container-name` properties can be combined by
using the `container` shorthand property:^[_The two values of the shorthand
were originally reversed, with `container-type` and then `container-name`.
Updated **August 18, 2022**._]

```scss
article,
section {
  container: demo / inline-size;
}

 @container demo (min-width: 30em) {
   .element {
      /* styles to apply */
   }
 }
```

### Apply @-rules at desired breakpoints

Now that a containment context has been defined, the `@container` rule is used
to tell the browser when and how styles should change inside each container.

With a narrow parent container, the `blockquote` features the image stacked on
top of the text.

{{ embed.figure(
  data=[{
    img: 'blog/2021/narrowquote.png',
    alt: 'profile image on top of quote'
  }],
  caption='The profile image sits on top of the quote in narrow containers.'
) }}

At the first breakpoint, the layout for the `blockquote` changes so that the
profile image moves from being above the quote to sitting next to it, and the
text describing the speaker gets a heavier weight applied.

{{ embed.figure(
  data=[{
    img: 'blog/2021/break1.png',
    alt: 'profile image next to quote'
  }],
  caption='The profile image changes position at the first breakpoint to sit next to the quote.'
) }}

```scss
/* change styles according to container size */
@container (min-width: 35em) {

  .quote {
    grid-gap: 1rem;
    grid-template: "media quote" auto/ max-content 1fr;
  }

  .media {
    align-items: center;
  }

  .source {
    font-weight: bold;
  }
}
```

At the second breakpoint, the size of the text for the quote and the attribution
grows, the background changes color, and the overall shape of the `blockquote`
changes by way of a `clip-path`.

{{ embed.figure(
  data=[{
    img: 'blog/2021/break2.png',
    alt: 'blockquote with magenta background and clip-path'
  }],
  caption='At a wider breakpoint, the blockquote gets a clip-path and a different background color.'
) }}

```scss
@container (min-width: 60em) {

  .quote {
    --quote-size: 1.5rem;
    --quote-background: darkmagenta;
    clip-path: polygon(
      -0.04% 100.6%,
      1.12% -0.52%,
      95.65% 11.18%,
      96.46% 90.05%
    );
    padding: 1.25em 3em;
    max-width: unset;
  }

  .source {
    font-size: 1.1rem;
  }
}
```

Any styles inside of one of these `@container` blocks will be applied when the
container fulfills the condition of the query.

Just as with `@media` queries, authors can write as many `@container` queries as
needed.

## All together now

With each `blockquote` sitting in a different sized container, they all look
slightly different, at the same viewport size.

{{ embed.figure(
  data=[{
    img: 'blog/2021/allquotes.png',
    alt: 'three blockquotes, styled differently'
  }],
  caption='The same blockquote component gets styled differently depending on its container size.'
) }}

## What's next?

It's still very early in the proposal process, so a lot regarding how container
queries work could change.

- There might be a way to contain only the block axis.
- Queries could also be made against properties like `aspect-ratio`,
  `orientation,` or even [custom properties and layout
  states](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5989).
- We already have viewport-relative units like `vh` and `vw`.
  [Container-relative units](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5888)
  could be on the horizon as well.

{% callout 'note', update %}

- [Container-relative units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#container_query_length_units)
have been available to use in all major browsers since February 2023.
- Most Chromium based browsers added support for
[`scroll-state`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_conditional_rules/Container_scroll-state_queries)
containment in February of 2025. As of this update, it's avaible in a browser
preview version of Opera.
- Style queries, the ability to query a computed value of a containing
  element, have been partially implented by most browsers (no support
  in Firefox yet). The current implementation allows for the querying of
  custom property values:

  ```css
  @container style(--theme: light) {
    /* styles to apply here */
  }
  ```

  Browsers are still working on adding support for using style queries to
  evaluate booleans (`@container style(gap) {...}`) and property-value pairs
  (`@container style(display: flex) {...}`).
- Size queries have made it possible to now query a containing element's
  `aspect-ratio` and orientation.
