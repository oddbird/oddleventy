You have an idea for a custom digital product you’d like to build, and it’s time to decide how to build it. One of your friends swears you won’t succeed unless you build a native mobile app for iPhone. A colleague argues that a responsive web app is the only way to go. Who’s right? Are there alternative options? The decision of how to build your app is quite important – affecting project scope, timeline, and budget – but understanding when to choose one option over another can seem insurmountably difficult.

The great news is that you don’t need to spend years becoming a web developer yourself in order to make a wise choice. In the following article, we’ll dig into the three main options for building mobile apps: Responsive Web Apps (RWAs), Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), and Native Mobile Apps, and how to determine the best option for your project. As you read, think about who your app will serve, what their most pressing needs are, and how your app will meet those needs.

## What are RWAs, PWAs, and Native Mobile Apps?
Here are the biggest differences in a nutshell.

- **Responsive Web App (RWA)** - An application that runs in a browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, and responds to fit any screen size on any device.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - A responsive web app with additional capabilities that mimic a native mobile app.
- **Native Mobile App** - An app built specifically for one particular mobile operating system, like iOS or Android.


## Progressive Web App - Best of Both Worlds

> **TL;DR**
>
> If your top priority is some combination of wide reach and
> advanced capabilities, you will want to investigate the
> progressive web app (PWA) option for your app project.
