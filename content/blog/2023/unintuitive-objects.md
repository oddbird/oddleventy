summary: |
   Do your clients contact you because they can't find their way to the info they need on your website? Have you ever been asked to design a more intuitive or user-friendly app? Ever found yourself stabbing at your phone wondering why some piece of content isn't interactive in the way it should be? If so, I'd like to introduce you to unintuitive objects. As a UX designer at OddBird, unintuitive objects have been key to architecting user-friendly and intuitive web products. A warning, though, before you continue. Once you see unintuitive objects, you won't be able to unsee them.

As a certified OOUX Strategist, I've been noticing unintuitive objects and trying to avoid them in my own designs since 2020. That was the year when (among many other things) I first took Sophia Prater's [Object-Oriented UX Masterclass](https://www.ooux.com/training).

As Sophia says, "All humans think in objects â€”designers, end-users, and those who painted the caves of Chauvet. So, as we make our user experiences more object-oriented, we also make them more *intuitive*." [ooux.com](https://www.ooux.com/what-is-ooux)

An *object* in a web project is defined as something that has "structure, instances, and purpose." [OOUX Glossary]
