You have an idea for a custom digital product you’d like to build, and it’s time to decide how to build it. One of your friends swears you won’t succeed unless you build a native mobile app for iPhone. A colleague argues that a responsive web app is the only way to go. Who’s right? Are there alternative options? The decision of how to build your app is quite important – affecting project scope, timeline, and budget – but understanding when to choose one option over another can seem insurmountably difficult.

The great news is that you don’t need to spend years becoming a web developer yourself in order to make a wise choice. In the following article, we’ll dig into the three main options for building mobile apps: Responsive Web Apps (RWAs), Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), and Native Mobile Apps, and how to determine the best option for your project. As you read, think about who your app will serve, what their most pressing needs are, and how your app will meet those needs.

## What are RWAs, PWAs, and Native Mobile Apps?
Here are the biggest differences in a nutshell.

- **Responsive Web App (RWA)** - An application that runs in a browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, and responds to fit any screen size on any device.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - A responsive web app with additional capabilities that mimic a native mobile app.
- **Native Mobile App** - An app built specifically for one particular mobile operating system, like iOS or Android.


## Native Mobile App - Best for Advanced Capabilities

> **TL;DR**

A native mobile app is an app created specifically for one particular mobile platform such as iOS, Android, or Windows. Native mobile apps are built using programming languages and tools unique to each platform. Swift or Objective-C for iOS. Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages along with SDK and APK tools for Android.

### Choose a Native Mobile App when…
### Advanced Capabilities
…when your project requires a high level of hardware or software integration.

Native apps can access all of a device's hardware and software features. For example, unlike RWAs, native mobile apps can integrate directly with a specific mobile device’s GPS for geofencing, access light and proximity sensors, or use a device’s camera.

### High Performance
…when you need advanced performance.

Native mobile apps are optimized for a specific platform. Because of this specialization, they can provide a higher level of processing power for things like large videos or games with lots of animation compared to an RWA. This difference is especially pronounced when there is limited or no access to an internet connection.

### Advance Security
…when you require advanced security.

A native mobile app offers advanced security beyond the typical HTTPS encryption available with an RWA. If you are developing a banking product or need to meet strict HIPPA requirements, a native mobile app is a better option than an RWA.

### Discoverable Via App Store
…when the people you want to reach will look for your app in an app store.

Native mobile apps live in app stores like the Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store. If your research shows that the people you want to reach typically look for the type of content you will provide in app stores, or if they all use the same app store, or if you want to build your marketing plan around app stores, then a native mobile app is a better choice than the RWA which is not listed in app stores.

### Don’t choose a Native Mobile App when…
### Higher Development & Maintenance Costs
…when you want to keep short and long-term costs down.

Native mobile apps require a unique codebase for each platform. For example, if you wanted to make the same native mobile app available on both Android and iOS mobile devices, you would need to build one codebase for Android and a separate codebase for iOS. Each codebase requires different proprietary technologies and likely requires separate teams of developers to build and maintain each platform. It is frequently more expensive to reach the same range of people with a native mobile app compared to an RWA.

### Lengthy Development
…when it’s a priority to make your app available to users quickly.

Because native mobile apps require a separate codebase for each platform you want to support, development takes longer than it does to develop a single codebase for an RWA. Additionally, each app store has its own set of requirements in order to launch an app. These can sometimes be complex. Wait times for app store approval to publish the app or an update can be lengthy as well.

### Not Discoverable Via Search
…when the people you want to reach will look for your content with a search engine.

Unlike for RWAs, search engines don’t index native mobile apps. If your user research indicates that people frequently use search engines to search for the type of content you offer, an RWA may be a better choice. Alternatively, you could build a marketing website that introduces your app and links people to the appropriate app store for download.

### Limited Reach
…when you want to reach a broad audience across devices.

Because it takes longer and costs more to reach the same range of people with a native mobile app than with an RWA and because native mobile apps are offer less backward compatibility, the number of people who can access a native mobile app will likely always be more limited than the number of people who can access an RWA.
