  If you have an idea for a digital product,
  you may be wondering if you should build a
  responsive web app, PWA, or native app.
  Is one option inherently better?
  What are the pros and cons?

## Responsive Web App, PWA, and Native Mobile App Defined
Here are three quick definitions
highlighting the biggest differences
between responsive web apps,
progressive web apps,
and native mobile apps.

- **Responsive Web App** -
An application that runs in a browser,
such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari,
and responds to fit any screen size on any device.

- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** -
A responsive web app
with additional capabilities
that are similar to a native mobile app.

- **Native Mobile App** -
An app built specifically
for one particular mobile operating system,
either iOS, Android, or Windows.

To decide which type of app
would suit your project best,
a good place to start
is with your major goals.
How do you want to serve people
with this digital project?

## Best Option for Wide Reach

If your top priority is
to reach as many people as possible,
as quickly as possible,
while keeping costs down,
a responsive web app
is likely the best option
for your digital product.

A responsive web app is built
to resize and rearrange its content
in a way that best suits
whatever screen size and browser
each person chooses --
instantly providing a consistent experience
no matter the device.
A person can open a responsive web app,
on any device from a small mobile phone or tablet,
to a laptop or giant desktop screen.
They can also decide which browser to use:
Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari,
or perhaps a mobile browser.
So whether a person has the latest iPhone
or an old laptop,
whether they are at the office,
on a bus,
or in their home,
if they have access to wifi or data,
they have access to a responsive web app.

Another neat thing about responsive web apps
is that they do all this responding
to screen sizes and browsers
from a single "codebase."
The term "codebase" is developer speak for
a collection of code
used to build a particular software system,
application, or software component.

In contrast,
if you wanted to reach the same range of people
on their device of choice
with native mobile app technology,
you would need to develop
as many different codebases
as platforms you wanted to support.

For example, a native mobile app
that is available on Google mobile devices
requires a codebase for the Android operating system (OS)
written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages.
To provide that same app
to people using Apple mobile devices,
developers would need to build another codebase for iOS
with Swift or Objective-C.
If you wanted to provide the same content
to people on non-mobile devices
a third codebase would need to be developed,
maybe a native desktop app or even a web app.
Because of these propietary technology requirements,
you may also want to hire
separate teams of specialists
to build the separate cobebases.

(Android Developer Documentation https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fundamentals)

The ability of a responsive web app
to reach a wide range of people
with fewer developers
building and maintaining one codebase
means you could pay less
for the initial development
as well as for the long-term maintenance.

To be clear,
building any kind of app is not a low cost endeavor.
Even a very simple responsive web app
that creates, edits, and deletes data
could easily have a price tag of $10K,
and very complex web apps
such as a social media platform
or project management software
cost many millions of dollars
to design, develop, and maintain.

But when comparing
responsive web apps, PWAs, and native mobile apps,
the type of app most likely
to help you reach a broad range of people
for the least development time
and the lowest cost
is a responsive web app.

## Best Option for Advanced Capabilities

If your goal is to provide
a high level of specialized capability,
especially for a specific device,
you probably need to build
a native mobile app.


## Best of Both Worlds

You may have seen this coming,
but if your goal is a hybrid
of wide reach
and advanced capabilities,
you will want to investigate
the progressive web app option
for your app project.
