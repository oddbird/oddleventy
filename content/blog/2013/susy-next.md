summary: |
  The web is littered with grid systems and 'frameworks' that force your
  code & design into narrowly defined patterns. Even the most semantic of
  us have had to push specialized techniques in order to create a usable
  syntax.

  But Sass has come a long way, and I'm convinced that it's time for
  something new.

  What if you had a layout system that bends completely to the needs of
  your site? What if you could use one unified syntax for handling
  responsive layouts of any kind? What if you had a modular system that
  let you mix-and-match to customize for every site, and change your
  output with simple extensions?

## Susy Next (A Merger)

I'm excited to announce Susy Next, a joint project from the creators of
[Singularity], [Salsa], [Breakpoint], and [Susy]. We'll be working
together to design and build a unified layout system under the Susy
name.
