OddBird is proposing the introduction of parts of SCSS syntax into the
indented format. Some highlights:

- Multi-line statements for long values, improving readability of properties
  like `grid-template`.
- Linebreaks are treated as whitespace anywhere you can't end a statement
- A "SCSS-in-Sass" syntax to opt in to SCSS formatting inline.
- Optional semicolons
