summary:
  CSS has a range of new color functions
  that support wider color gamuts (like `display-p3`)
  and perceptually uniform color adjustments (like `oklch`).
  Sass now provides additional tools for
  working with these new color formats,
  and converting between them.

If you want to learn more about CSS color spaces
and the tradeoff they provide,
or if you're just interested in the new Sass functionality,
I've written about it
[on the Sass Blog](https://sass-lang.com/blog/wide-gamut-colors-in-sass/).

Some of the highlights:

- Sass colors have a 'space' that they are defined in.
  We can inspect that using `color.space()`.
- A color's space doesn't change unless we explicitly convert between spaces
  using `color.to-space()`.
- Out-of-gamut channels are also preserved
  unless we explicitly adjust a color into a specific gamut
  using `color.to-gamut()`.
- Color manipulation and inspection functions
  like `color.adjust()` or `color.channel()`
  accept a `$space` parameter for making adjustments or inspecting
  in an arbitrary color space.
