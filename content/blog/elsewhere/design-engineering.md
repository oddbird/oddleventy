I'm a fan of all these authors,
and excited to read the whole book.
They also include [interviews][] with
Ire Aderinokun, Brenda Storer, Stephanie Rewis,
Anna Vu, and Matt Rothenberg.

The full book is available free
as a website, epub, PDF, or audiobook.
I talked to them about pairing designers with developers,
and finding the right levels of fidelity for a mockup
depending on the situation:
