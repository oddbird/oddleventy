summary: |
  I've often used `initial` and `unset` in my CSS --
  global keywords that can be applied to any property.
  The difference is small, but important:
  `unset` allows inheritance,
  while `initial` does not.
  But then Firefox implemented `revert` and I was confused --
  how is this one different from the others?

{% import "embed.macros.njk" as embed %}

{{ embed.figure(
  data=media,
  caption='Revert takes user and user-agent styles into consideration'
) }}

It turns out `revert` is the one I wanted all along.
It rolls back styles to the expected browser default for each element,
rather than using the specification default for each property.
