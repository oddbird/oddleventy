  alt: Firefox Developer Tools shows helpful information about inactive CSS
summary: |
  There are a number of property & value combinations
  that can lead to CSS being inactive,
  and now Firefox will tell you why.
  Open the developer tools,
  and look for the greyed-out property with an info-box on hover.
