summary: |
  The `display` property has been in CSS from the beginning,
  handling everything from `block` and `inline` boxes
  to `list-items` and full layout systems like `flexbox` or `grid`.
  Now the `display` syntax is getting an upgrade
  to match it's multiple uses.

{% import "embed.macros.njk" as embed %}

{{ embed.figure(
  data=media,

) }}

The new `display` spec adds flow and flow-root values,
and allows for setting inner layout (`grid`, `flex`, etc)
as well as outer box type (`inline`, `block`), and more.

It might not be something we use much right away --
but it still helps me understand all the power inside this one property.
