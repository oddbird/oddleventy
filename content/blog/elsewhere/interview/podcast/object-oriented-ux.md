summary: |
  Sondra and Miriam chat with Sophia
  about using her ORCA methodology
  (Objects, Relationships, CTAs, and Attributes)
  in OddBird's work with clients.
  We dive into the ways OOUX
  facilitates a flow of conversation
  between designers and back-end developers,
  and get a sneak peak of Miriam's work on
  the new container query features
  coming to CSS.
