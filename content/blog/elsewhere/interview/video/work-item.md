summary: |
  I joined Den Delimarsky
  on the Work Item podcast
  to talk about my path as a developer --
  from building a website for my theater company,
  to building a career and a company around it.
  In this show, we talk about the power of the web,
  and how CSS is like poetry for the browser.
