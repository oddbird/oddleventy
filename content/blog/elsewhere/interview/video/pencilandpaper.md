    Weekly fireside chat:
    What's the job of a design engineer?
    Featuring Miriam Suzanne

  - CSS
  - Process
summary: |
  There are often tall walls
  between designers and developers,
  sometimes with only one
  significant handoff moment during a sprint.
  We discuss the role of the 'design engineer'
  and what it means for workflows,
  collab with their product team,
  and the end-user experience.
