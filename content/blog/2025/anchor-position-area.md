  `position-area` might be my favorite part of the CSS Anchor Positioning spec,
  with a ton of features packed in to make things just... work.
  But there's no magic here, just a few key parts that work well.

{% import 'embed.macros.njk' as embed %}

{% callout 'note', false %}

The examples in this article are best viewed in a Chromium browser, version 131
or later.

{% endcallout %}

On the surface, `position-area` seems like just a shorthand.
Just replace `top: anchor(bottom); left: anchor(right)`
with `position-area: bottom right` and it works.

Or go even further, and replace that with `position-area: end`.

{{ embed.codepen(
  id='zxOVXOm',
  title='position-area containing block',
  user='jamessw',
  height=300,
  tab='css,result'
) }}

The idea behind `position-area` is that in most cases, you want your positioned
element to be touching a specific corner or edge of the anchor. `position-area`
creates a grid around the anchor, and lets you place your positioned element
within that grid.

[Anchor-tool.com](https://anchor-tool.com/) is a fantastic tool for exploring
the different values for positioning an element within that grid.

But `position-area` is more than a shorthand for `anchor()`, introducing some
behaviors that may be surprising.

## A new containing block

One of the key differences between using `anchor()` and `position-area` is that
`position-area` creates a new containing block for the positioned element. While
we're used to dealing with containing blocks when positioning `position:
absolute` inside of a `position: relative` ancestor, `position-area` creates a
containing block that does not map to an element.

This containing block is generated by the grid area that you select using
`position-area`. For instance, with `position-area: top left`, the new
containing block starts at the top left corner of the anchor's containing block
and extends to the top left corner of the anchor itself.

{{ embed.img(
  src='blog/2025/anchor-area-containing-block.png',
  alt='A 9-space grid, like a tic-tac-toe board, with an Anchor in the center square, and a square within the top left square for a new containing block.',
  attrs={
    'class': 'align-center',
    'width': '1089',
    'height': '997'
  }
) }}

Note that this is not the positioned element's box, but rather the containing block _for_ the positioned element's box.

## Percentages

One of the ways we observe a containing block is that percentages are resolved
in relation to the containing block. That means a `padding: 5%` on an element
positioned using `position-area` will have a padding of 5% of the size of the
containing block, the section of the grid that was selected.

{{ embed.codepen(
  id='MYgMpMM',
  title='position-area containing block',
  user='jamessw',
  height=500
) }}

In this case, the padding on the element positioned with `anchor()` is much
larger, since its containing block is the viewport, not the grid area created by
`position-area.

## Self alignment

Using `position-area` also changes the normal `self-alignment`, so that the
positioned element is placed near to the anchor within its containing block.

What that means is that you can use `place-self` on the positioned element, even
outside of a `grid` or `flex` context.

{{ embed.codepen(
  id='raBEmOV',
  title='position-area self alignment',
  user='jamessw',
  height=600
) }}

## Shifts to prevent overflow

This is perhaps the most magical portion of all. In some instances, the browser
will adjust the position to attempt to avoid accidental overflow.

If, after applying padding and margins, your positioned element would overflow
the newly created containing block but would fit inside its original container
block, it will get shifted to prevent overflow.

In this example, the targets are all positioned with `position-area: center`.
The top and bottom targets are shifted towards the center because they would
otherwise overflow their original containing block, which is the `div` with the
dashed border. They are shifted just enough to be flush with their containing
block.

{{ embed.codepen(
  id='XJrLzWa',
  title='position-area self alignment - absolute positioning',
  user='jamessw',
  height=350
) }}

Note that in that example, the targets are `position: absolute`. If instead, the
targets are `position: fixed`, the targets do not overflow their original
containing block (the viewport) and so no shifting happens.

{{ embed.codepen(
  id='ByBgbQa',
  title='position-area self alignment - fixed position',
  user='jamessw',
  height=350
) }}

In playing with this, I was only able to get shifting to happen when a grid area
containing the center was selected, for instance with `center` or `span-right`
or `span-all`. If only a corner is selected, no shifting happens.

While I think this is a smart default to avoid overflowing content, I suspect
this will occasionally be a surprise to developers.

## Try it out

`position-area` is available in Chromium browsers. It was initially called `inset-area`, but was renamed in the Chromium 129 release.

The [Anchor Positioning Polyfill](https://anchor-polyfill.netlify.app/) does not yet support `position-area`. This article was written as part of our exploration into the spec, and if you would like to sponsor further development, please get in [touch](/contact/)!
