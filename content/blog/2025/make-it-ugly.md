recently
[shared a New York Times interview](https://adactio.com/journal/22256)
with (musician) Brian Eno.
We're reaching Inception-levels of quotation here,
I know --
but in that interview,
Brian quotes from an unnamed architect friend,
talking about the introduction of computers:

> It didn’t help us make good buildings.
> It helped us make things that looked like they might be good buildings.

The architect refers to this
as a 'premature sheen' that software can add,
distracting from the real questions at hand
early in a project.
It's easy to make something _look good_,
before you've confirmed that it _works_.

Jeremy makes an apt analogy
to generative models today,
but I think this idea is useful to consider
when communicating with clients,
no matter what tools are involved.

As designers and developers
we are constantly immersed in the creative process.
We (hopefully) understand the steps
that a new project has to go through
from idea to execution.
It's not a straight line,
but requires cycles of experimentation and editing,
prototyping, sketching, drafting, and polishing.

When I review a design concept,
I know where we are in that process --
and it changes the kind of feedback that I give.
If we're early in the process,
I'm going to ignore issues like typographic kerning,
and focus on overall approach.
_Does the concept work_?
If I received a similar mockup
later in the process
I'd review it differently --
_is every detail in place_?

I don't mean that designers
are actually sending me the same document
at the start,
and again later in the same process.
But that when they send me a mockup,
I know _from experience_
how to focus on the currently-relevant
aspects of the design,
and set aside questions that we'll get to later.

I also know that as a designer,
it can be helpful to work
at a higher level of fidelity --
even when sketching rough ideas.
Design is always contextual,
so providing a rough font-and-color palette
might tell you something about the layout
that you wouldn't see in a napkin sketch.
That 'premature sheen' can be _useful_,
if you know what you're looking at.

But we're only able to do that
because we're all familiar with the process.
Most clients and stakeholders on a new project
don't have that same level of experience.
If we show clients a highly designed mockup,
they will consistently focus on the details like
colors and fonts,
even if we're asking higher level questions about
content and layout.
And since the web is fundamentally responsive and interactive,
_no static mockup is ever complete_.
We know that,
but clients often find that hard to understand.

We don't think that's a reason
to avoid mockups entirely.
A mockup of the site in a specific state
can be a helpful tool for our internal process.
But we know that a mockup with 'premature sheen' --
a mockup that _looks too good_ --
can quickly become distracting or misleading for clients.

Over the years we've developed an approach
to avoid showing clients any mockup
that looks more complete than it is.
Sometimes that involves removing the colors
with a grayscale filter,
or changing all the fonts
to something off-brand,
or scribbling notes on top of the design
to obscure the detail.

We want to help clients focus
on the right questions at the right times.
And to do that
we remove any 'sheen'
that's even potentially premature.

Show clients something ugly,
so they know what they're looking at.
