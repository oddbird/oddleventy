title: Make it ugly, for clients
sub: It's important to focus the conversation

Jeremy Keith recently
shared an interview
including this great second-hand quote
from an architect,
about their first use of computers:

> It didn’t help us make good buildings.
> It helped us make things that looked like they might be good buildings.

The architect refers to this
as a "premature sheen" provided by software,
which distracts from the question at hand.
It looks good, but _does it work_?

Jeremy makes an apt analogy
to generative models today,
but I think this idea is useful to consider
when communicating with clients,
no matter what tools are in use.

As designers and developers
we are constantly immersed in the creative process.
We (hopefully) understand the steps
that a new project has to go through
from idea to execution.
It's not a straight line,
but requires cycles of experimentation and editing,
prototyping, sketching, drafting, and polishing.

When I review a design concept,
I know where we are in that process --
and it changes the kind of feedback that I give.
If we're early in the process,
I'm going to ignore issues like typographic kerning,
and focus on overall approach.
_Does it work_?
Later in the process
I might see a nearly identical mockup,
but this time I'm asking
_is every detail in place_?

Similarly, the OddBird designers
sometimes find it helpful to work
at a high level of fidelity --
even when sketching rough ideas.
Tools make that easy to do,
and it helps them see where they are going.
Nice fonts and branded colors
don't distract from their ability to focus
on layout and flow --
so what's the harm?

But we're only able to do that
because we're all familiar with the process.
And that's not true for most clients
and stakeholders on a project.
If we show clients a highly designed mockup,
they will consistently focus on the parts
that we know aren't ready.
And since the web is fundamentally responsive and interactive,
_no static mockup is ever complete_.

We don't think that's a reason
to avoid mockups entirely.
A screenshot of the browser in a specific state
can be a helpful tool for our internal process.
But we know from experience that mockups --
especially mockups that _look good_ --
have a premature sheen that's easily misleading.

Over the years we've developed an approach
to avoid showing clients any mockup
that looks more complete than it is.
Sometimes that involves removing the colors
with a grayscale filter,
or changing all the fonts
to something off-brand,
or scribbling notes on top of the design
to obscure the detail.

We want to help clients focus
on the right questions at the right times.
And to do that
we remove any 'sheen'
that's even potentially premature.

Show clients something ugly,
so they know what they're looking at.
