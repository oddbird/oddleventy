Sacha Greif's annual
[State of CSS survey](https://2024.stateofcss.com/en-US/)
wrapped up recently,
and the results are available.

I've seen a number of people
commenting on the
[demographics data](https://2024.stateofcss.com/en-US/demographics/),
asking what it says about our industry.
Those are great questions to ask.
For example:
men in the US seem to make significantly more money
than the rest of the field.

But I haven't seen analysis asking
if the survey demographics actually match the industry.
And for this,
I would include a number of demographic questions
from the 'CSS Usage' section:
like the [industry sector](https://2024.stateofcss.com/en-US/usage/#industry_sector),
[CSS purpose](https://2024.stateofcss.com/en-US/usage/#usage_type),
and the
[balance of time respondents spend writing CSS (and HTML) vs JS](https://2024.stateofcss.com/en-US/usage/#css_js_balance).
Do we know how representative this is?

- Are 80% of global CSS authors actually white?
- Are 90% of CSS authors men?
- Do the majority of CSS authors spend more time writing JS?
- Is CSS mostly used for web apps?
- Does the industry skew young to the same degree as the survey?

If you don't know [Kevin Powell's work teaching CSS](https://www.kevinpowell.co/),
I highly recommend it.
But as you might expect,
his audience is weighted towards students
and people starting out in the field.
If he's a [primary source for respondents](https://2024.stateofcss.com/en-US/demographics/#source),
that's likely to impact the demographics.

And it's great to get that perspective!
But it still requires us to ask:
are we looking at data about CSS authors generally,
or are we looking at a small slice of the industry?
And is that slice more broadly representative?

In many cases,
polls use demographics data to
_adjust for response bias_ --
but that requires an understanding of how the demographics
interact with other data points.
How would it change our interpretation of the survey more generally
if we knew the answers to those questions?

- Do most CSS authors test their designs only on desktop,
  or is that specific to people who write CSS on the side?
- Is Tailwind broadly popular,
  or within certain demographics?
- What other questions might rise up from this analysis?

I don't have answers here.
I'm just not sure what I'm looking at,
or how it should be read.
