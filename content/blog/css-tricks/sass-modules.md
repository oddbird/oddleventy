summary: |
  Sass recently launched a major new feature you might recognize from
  other languages: a module system. The new syntax will replace `@import`
  with `@use` and `@forward` --a big step forward for making Sass partials
  (one of the language's most used features) more readable, performant,
  and safe. This article goes into detail, but you can also read our
  "[Sass Modules, a Primer]" article for the quick introduction.
