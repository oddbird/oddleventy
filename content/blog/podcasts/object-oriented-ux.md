  Sondra and Miriam chat with Sophia
  about using her ORCA methodology
  in OddBird's work this clients.
  ORCA stands for:
  Objects, Relationships, CTAs, and Attributes.
  We dive into the ways OOUX
  facilitates a flow of conversation
  between designers and back-end developers.
  We get a sneak peak of Miriam's work on
