CSS Day 2016 covered a wide range of topics for a one day conference
including SVG, animation, color theory, design, layout and more.
Throughout the day, a focus on code architecture was a theme. Attendees
heard a few different perspectives which were interesting to listen to
and compare.

Below are the available videos and slides of each session, including two
from our very own OddBirds.

## SVG: from Practical to Wild by [Sarah Drasner]

Sarah has become one of the primary voices on web-SVG and animation,
