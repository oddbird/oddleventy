Date: **Thursday, June 1** Time: **11:30am - 12:30pm** (MST) Location:
[OddFriends Slack]

OddBird is holding an open question and answer session on a free slack
channel to talk with you about developing a web app from start to finish
– the decisions you need to make about team and technology and testing,
budget and development costs, and how to build a user-base without
relying on "viral" mysticism. **Join channel \#q-a on the OddBird
Friends Slack.**

## Questions like:

-   How much does an MVP or prototype cost?
-   How do I validate my concept with real users?
-   Who should be on my development team?
-   How can I communicate effectively with developers?
-   What technology should I use?
-   How can I build a user-base?
-   What's the difference between a mockup and a wireframe?

It's your hour. What do you want to know, from web-product experts in
the field?

## Tips to Save Money on Development

1\. If you don't have the budget to develop a full MVP or even a
prototype of your web application, one option is to start with a
hi-fidelity mockup. Mockups look great in a professional pitch and take
a fraction of the time and money to create.

2\. Consider hiring a user experience designer to create an interactive
mockup in [Adobe Xd] or [InVision], and without paying for a single line
of code you can rapidly test your ideas with users, updating the
features to fit their needs.
