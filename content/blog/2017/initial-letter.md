  Using an emphasized initial letter is a technique that has been used for
  centuries. Let's dive in to see some ways you can apply it to your
  project to help guide your reader with visual hierarchy.

{% import 'embed.macros.njk' as embed %}

We have some pretty great new(ish) properties we can use in CSS to make
our designs more unique and help provide useful visual cues for your
audience. One of these newer techniques can be used to create the drop
caps that we know and love often found in print design. This technique
has been used for centuries to bring emphasis to a new section of text,
and we finally have a decent way to easily apply drop caps with CSS.

## CSS Initial-Letter Syntax

First you need an element or class to use as the target, and then we
will append the `::first-letter` pseudo element. The property is
`initial-letter` and the value is the number of lines you would like
your initial letter to expand.

```css
.intro::first-letter {
  initial-letter: 7;
  -webkit-initial-letter: 7;
}
```

This code would give us a drop cap seven lines tall, like the large
letter "I" in this example:

{{ embed.img(
  src='blog/2017/initial-letter/minions-initial-letter.jpg',
  alt='inital-letter demo',
  attrs={'class': 'img-border align-center'}
) }}

------

A few months ago we briefly introduced Feature Queries when we wrote
about [CSS Grid Layout]. Feature Queries will play an important role in
using initial-letter today. As a reminder, a Feature Query will ask the
browser to check for support for a specific property and value:

```scss
@supports (property: value) {
  property: value;
}
```

When we wrap our block in a Feature Query, we can add additional values
that we would only want applied <span class="title-ref">if</span>
`initial-letter` is supported.

```scss
@supports (initial-letter: 7) or (-webkit-initial-letter: 7) {
  .intro::first-letter {
    color: hsl(350, 50%, 50%);
    initial-letter: 3;
    -webkit-initial-letter: 3;
  }
}
```

The specific number used in the @supports line for initial-letter does
not matter unlike properties that require a keyword like
`(display: grid)`.

As of December 2016, only Safari supports initial-letter. Fortunately,
you can still use this as an enhancement and fake it 'til you make it to
achieve a similar outcome. By using the operator `not` we can tell
browsers that do not support `initial-letter` to use alternate styles.

```scss
$font-size: 1.15rem;
$cap-size: $font-size * 6.25;

@supports (not(initial-letter: 5)) and (not(-webkit-initial-letter: 5)) {
  .intro::first-letter {
    color: hsl(350, 50%, 50%);
    font-size: $cap-size;
    float: left;
    line-height: .7;
    margin: 17px 2px 0 0;
  }
}
```

These “magic numbers” are not universal so if you change a value or
font-family you will likely have to edit these values. We could probably
spend some time to calculate the line-height and font-size more
programmatically, but it will not take into account the x-height of the
typeface you choose. Here is a screenshot of the resulting fallback and
enhancement:

  src='blog/2017/initial-letter/fallback-enhancement.jpg',
  alt='Fallback and enhancement in Chrome and Safari',
  attrs={'class': 'img-border align-center'}
) }}

Here is the CodePen demo:

<p data-height="530" data-theme-id="light" data-slug-hash="JbgvRe" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="stacy" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Initial Letter, with fallback and enhancement" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/stacy/pen/JbgvRe/">Initial Letter, with fallback and enhancement</a> by Stacy (<a href="https://codepen.io/stacy">@stacy</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

## Raised and Sunken Initial Letters

Another optional value we can use for our `initial-letter` property will
instruct the browser where to place the initial cap. After our drop cap
height value we will add a space and the number of lines we want our cap
to drop. A value equal to the initial height value is the default.

```scss
.raised-cap::first-letter {
  -webkit-initial-letter: 3 1;
  initial-letter: 3 1;
}

.sunken-cap::first-letter {
  -webkit-initial-letter: 3 2;
  initial-letter: 3 2;
}
```

{{ embed.img(
  src='blog/2017/initial-letter/sunken-raised-drop-caps.jpg',
  alt='Screenshot of raised, sunken, and drop cap demo',
  attrs={'class': 'img-border align-center'}
) }}

The following CodePen demo is available in Safari only:

<p data-height="830" data-theme-id="light" data-slug-hash="GNrYgY" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="stacy" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Initial Letter, showing multiple positions" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/stacy/pen/GNrYgY/">Initial Letter, showing multiple positions</a> by Stacy (<a href="https://codepen.io/stacy">@stacy</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
