  Google Analytics is great for gathering data on who uses your web
  application, but becomes worthless if spam sessions start infesting your
  data. Here's how we've tried to combat the problem for [oddbird.net].

{% import 'embed.macros.njk' as embed %}

Like many websites, we use [Google Analytics] to gather data about our
users – what OS and browser they used, how they came to our site, etc.
But a number of months ago we started seeing lots of this:

{{ embed.img(
  src='blog/2017/ga-spam/ga-spam.jpg',
  alt='Google Analytics spam',
  attrs={'class': 'img-border'}
) }}

It's not a new problem, but it's particularly problematic for smaller
sites that don't receive lots of traffic. On a given day, spam hits were
accounting for anywhere from ten to ninety (!) percent of our sessions.

) }}


There are [many solutions out there]; since we mostly saw spam in the
"referral" field, we wanted a simple way to block spam referrals from
being included in our analytics data.

## Blocking Spam Referrals

One common approach is to disallow any site visits where
`document.referrer` matches a known spam domain. There are [free
services] that create the necessary Google Analytics "filters" for you,
but they must be re-configured frequently as new spammers are added to
the list.

Instead, we tried [spam-referrals-blocker], which is a script that
blocks referrals found on a [community-contributed list of referrer
spammers]. Rather than relying on the owner of the script to update it
periodically with the latest disallowed-list – or maintaining our own fork of
the repo – we decided to fetch the latest list as part of our
build/deploy process, using [gulp] and [gulp-download][]:

```js
const gulp = require('gulp');
const download = require('gulp-download');

gulp.task('update-spammers', () => {
  const url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matomo-org/referrer-spam-blacklist/master/spammers.txt';
  return download(url).pipe(gulp.dest('path/to/js/'));
});
```

Once we have an up-to-date disallowed-list, we import it with the [webpack][]
[raw-loader] and block any referrer found on the list:

```js
import spammers from 'raw-loader!./spammers.txt';

window.isSpamReferral = function () {
  const list = spammers.split(' ');
  const currentReferral = document.referrer;
  if (currentReferral) {
    for (const spammer of list) {
      if (spammer && currentReferral.indexOf(spammer) !== -1) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
};
```

And in our HTML, after the JS file has been executed:

```html
<script>
  if(!window.isSpamReferral()) {
    // ... initialize Google Analytics
  }
</script>
```

### Bonus: Excluding Internal Traffic

Without much extra work, we can also exclude internal traffic from our
analytics data:

```js
const devHosts = [
  // List your local development servers
  'oddsite.hexxie.com:3000',
  'localhost:3000',
  '127.0.0.1:3000'
];

window.isDevelopment = () => devHosts.indexOf(window.location.host) !== -1;
```

And our modified HTML:

```html
<script>
  if(!window.isSpamReferral() && !window.isDevelopment()) {
    // ... initialize Google Analytics
  }
</script>
```

## Can't We Do Better Than That?

This approach has worked relatively well – in the first two weeks, we
only saw nine spam sessions sneak through. But we weren't entirely
thrilled with it, either.

First of all, a disallowed-list of domains-to-block is much more difficult to
maintain than an allowed-list of domains-to-allow (even if we've off-loaded
most of the maintenance to the community). And second, there's something
less-than-ideal about fetching a raw `.txt` file directly from someone
else's GitHub repo, making assumptions about the format of the file
contents, and then relying on it as part of our build/deploy process.

So we've recently also implemented many of the methods outlined in [this
guide], most notably [using an allowed-list filter to exclude any hostnames
we haven't explicitly authorized]. This takes care of most of the spam,
and is arguably cleaner and easier to maintain.

We haven't been using this technique for long, but so far the results
have been positive. If it continues to work well, we'll likely remove
the referral-blocking code entirely.
