Date: **Thursday, June 1** Time: **11:30am - 12:30pm** (MST) Location:
[OddFriends Slack]

OddBird is holding an open question and answer session on a free slack
channel to talk with you about developing a web app from start to finish
– the decisions you need to make about team and technology and testing,
budget and development costs, and how to build a user-base without
relying on "viral" mysticism. **Join channel \#q-a on the OddBird
Friends Slack.**

## Questions like:

- How much does an MVP or prototype cost?
- How do I validate my concept with real users?
- Who should be on my development team?
- How can I communicate effectively with developers?
- What technology should I use?
- How can I build a user-base?
- What's the difference between a mockup and a wireframe?

It's your hour. What do you want to know, from web-product experts in
the field?

## Tips to Save Money on Development

1. If you don't have the budget to develop a full MVP or even a
   prototype of your web application, one option is to start with a
   hi-fidelity mockup. Mockups look great in a professional pitch and take
   a fraction of the time and money to create.

2. Consider hiring a user experience designer to create an interactive
   mockup in [Adobe Xd] or [InVision], and without paying for a single line
   of code you can rapidly test your ideas with users, updating the
   features to fit their needs.
