  The term "username" is ambiguous. When designing a user model
  there are several kinds of names that are useful to include.
---

It’s time to start a new project. You want users, so the first thing you
do is add a user model with username and password fields and – whoa,
hold up.

What’s that username again? Is it the user’s email address? Is it an
arbitrary nickname that the user can choose? Is it an automatically
generated identifier that should never change?

## A Rose by Any Other Name Would Not Be Able To Log In

It’s not for nothing that they say naming things is [one of the hard
problems in computer science]. For modeling user accounts there are
three different name fields that you probably want, and for the sake of
avoiding confusion let’s not call *any* of them the username:

1.  The **user id**. This is the permanent, unchanging identifier of a
    particular user. It may be generated randomly or it may be an
    incrementing number, but the important thing is that it should not
    have any inherent meaning, and it should never change. That makes it
    safe for use internally throughout the system as a foreign key to
    refer to the user.
2.  The **display name** or screen name. This is what will actually be
    shown when referring to the user in the UI and notifications (to the
    user themself or to other users). This should be chosen by the user
    with few limitations (except perhaps on length or to avoid excessive
    whitespace). That gives users full flexibility to use their offline
    name (including in other writing systems), nickname, stage name, or
    even emoji. If it will be shown to multiple users, consider making
    it be unique to avoid confusion. It should be editable.
3.  The **login**. This is what the user will type to log in to the
    system (or what their password manager will type for them). You may
    be tempted to let users choose their own login, but we prefer to use
    their email address because it makes it less likely that the user
    will forget their login. Whatever it is, it must be unique among all
    the users, and should be editable. If it’s the email address,
    changing it should require responding to a verification email to
    verify control of the email account. (Some systems may want to allow
    a user to set up multiple logins including various email addresses,
    phone numbers, or social accounts.)

You probably noticed I *did not* include the user's given and family
names (and middle name and maiden name and...). Avoid collecting these as
separate fields unless you need to, i.e. for official or legal purposes.
Keep in mind that the preferred order of these names varies in different
cultures (so avoid calling them “first name” and “last name”). And keep
in mind that they may change over time. [Names are hard.]

## Building this User Model in Django

We like [Django] for building backends. There are a number of ways to
extend Django's default user model. Here's our custom `User` model that
meets the above guidelines:

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import PermissionsMixin
from django.contrib.auth.base_user import AbstractBaseUser

class User(AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin):
    email = models.EmailField("email address", unique=True)
    name = models.CharField("name", max_length=30, blank=True, unique=True)
    date_joined = models.DateTimeField(_("date joined"), auto_now_add=True)
    is_active = models.BooleanField(_("active"), default=True)

    objects = UserManager()

    USERNAME_FIELD = "email"
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = []

    def get_full_name(self):
        return self.name

    def get_short_name(self):
        return self.name
```

Like all Django models, it has a default `id` field which meets our
criteria for **user id**. There is a single `name` field which is used
when Django needs to display the user's name via the `get_full_name` and
`get_short_name` methods. And it has an `email` field which enforces
uniqueness and is configured as Django's USERNAME\_FIELD (which is
really the **login**).

(Note: This model requires a custom `UserManager` – I won't include that
here; see Vitor Freitas' helpful [How to Extend the Django User Model]
article for details.)

Add this model to a new Django project (it'll be easiest if you use it
from the start), configure it using the [AUTH\_USER\_MODEL setting], and
you'll be well on your way to never having to say the word “username”
again.
