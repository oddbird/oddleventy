  alt: Flexible grid column layout
summary: |
  **We're excited to introduce Susy 3.0**,
  a major update to our popular
  grid-math calculator --
  now more focused and flexible than ever.
  Susy was designed to make layout math easy,
  without forcing you into generic patterns and
  ugly markup. But grid systems are on the way out,
  replaced by real CSS layout specs that live in the browser.
  With Susy3, we want to help make that a smooth transition.

I remember when [Blueprint] first came out. Besides [Eric Meyer’s
Reset], it was one of the first open-source CSS libraries that our
industry started using en-masse. That's how I remember things, at least.
I had just quit my day job as a junior print designer to start
freelancing. A year later, I joined forces with [Carl] and then [Jonny]
to form OddBird.

At that point, every layout required extensive hacks to work across
browsers, and CSS frameworks quickly took over. But there are some
things you can't do in a pure CSS API based on classes. [Natalie Downe]
was proposing a more flexible approach to grids and toolkits, and [Chris
Eppstein] was pushing hard to show how [Sass] and [Compass] could
revolutionize CSS-sharing and tool APIs.

Susy came out of that mix in July, 2009. Nothing terribly original, just
putting the pieces together. I didn't have a GitHub account at the time,
so Carl published Susy on my behalf. The first draft was kind of ugly –
but a few people took interest, and helped me clean it up. Three years
later, it had become the inspiration for an entire genre of Sass grid
systems – with several creative adaptations like [Singularity] to keep
us on our toes.

## A Whole New World

We work on a different web now. Browser-hacks are mostly a thing of the
past, and we have real control over the box-model (one thing IE got
right the first time). Flexbox and the CSS Grid module are providing
real layout tools in the browser, with flexibility baked in.

Singularity recently [shut down development], and we considered doing
the same thing. Grid systems are on the decline for a good reason. It's
time to move away from these tools, and put our layouts back in the
browser. Instead of closing shop, though, we wanted to provide one more
major update truly designed for the edge-cases that remain.

Susy3 is stripped down to the core – a grid-math module we call `Su`,
and a syntax module to add API sugar over top. There are two primary API
functions, `span()` and `gutter()`, and a total of four configuration
settings.

That's right, Susy3 has no mixins. When we wrote the mixins for Susy1
and Susy2, floats were (practically) the only option, and required a
fair amount of hacking help. Mixins provided those shortcuts, at the
expense of user flexibility. But mixins also created a black-box of CSS
output, which made it more difficult for users to understand the code
they were writing.

The core of Susy has always been the math, and the "natural-language"
API. Accessing that math only through functions will allow Susy to get
out of your way, and work with any future layout technique you need:
floats, flexbox, tables, inline-block, even CSS Grids.

## CSS Grids

If you have the [browser-support matrix] to start using the [CSS Grid
module] directly, you should do it, and forget about Susy. Brilliant
developers like [Rachel Andrew] and [Jen Simmons] have been working hard
to provide tutorials, so I won't go into detail – but the results really
do feel like magic.

Remember the old 3-column "Holy Grail" layout, with equal-height
fixed-width sidebars and a fluid center? Here it is, in a few lines of
code:

{{ embed.codepen(
  id='0229f885f9a574c6d049b9d30dffc609',
  title='CSS Grid Demo',
  user='mirisuzanne'
) }}

In most cases, you can also provide a float, flexbox, or css-table
fallback by wrapping your grid code in the
`@supports (display: grid) {}` feature-query. You may still want Susy
around to help with the fallback options, until all your required
browsers catch up.

### Susy Columns & `grid-template-columns`

The Susy3 syntax has a lot in common with CSS Grid, because we want to
start moving people in that direction.

Our `columns` setting now matches the basic features of CSS
`grid-template-columns` – requiring a list of column-sizes, with the
optional `susy-repeat()` shortcut function, matching the CSS `repeat()`
option:

```scss
// Symmetrical layouts
$grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 120px);
$columns: susy-repeat(12, 120px);

// Asymmetrical and mixed-unit layouts
$grid-template-columns: 120px repeat(4, 1fr) 30em;
$columns: 120px susy-repeat(4) 30em;
```

Where CSS Grid uses the `fr` unit for fluid columns, we use unitless
numbers. A column of width `2` in Susy will work similarly to a `2fr`
column in CSS. The default setting (`susy-repeat(4)`) defines a grid of
4 fluid columns, identical to a setting of `1 1 1 1`.

Here are a few examples of different column settings:

```scss
// 12-column em-based grid... (these have same result)
$columns: susy-repeat(12, 5em);
$columns: 5em 5em 5em 5em 5em 5em 5em 5em 5em 5em 5em 5em;

// holy grail grid from above...
$columns: 12em 1 200px;

// add more columns in the fluid area of holy grail...
$columns: 12em susy-repeat(4) 200px;
$columns: 12em 1 1 1 1 200px;

// repeated alternating columns...
$columns: susy-repeat(3, 8em 200px);
$columns: 8em 200px 8em 200px 8em 200px;
```

This is a breaking change from Susy2, which allowed a single number `12`
to represent 12 equal-and-fluid columns. That has been replaced with
`susy-repeat(12)` for clarity and consistency with CSS.

Since Susy does not have direct access to the DOM, we generate `calc()`
output for non-comparable and mixed fluid/static grids.

### Susy Gutters & `grid-column-gap`

Susy gutters haven't changed at all since version two, although our new
`calc` output allows you to mix units in new ways. This is similar to
the CSS `grid-column-gap` property, accepting any gutter-length to place
between columns. A unitless gutter setting will act as a fraction, on
the same scale as any unitless columns. Gutters with units will remain
static:

```scss
// unitless fluid gutters...
$gutters: 0.25;

// static gutters...
$gutters: 10px;
```

## Simplify Your Math

If you can't use CSS Grids yet, you might want Susy to help simplify
grid-math calculations. Or you might be able to avoid that with a few
tricks to simplify your math, and handle it manually.

### Box-Sizing: Border-Box

First, fix the browser [box-model] by setting a global `box-sizing`:

```scss
* { box-sizing: border-box; }
```

I recommend setting this globally by default, no matter how you handle
layouts. Border-box sizing means you can set a width, without worrying
that padding or borders will ruin the calculation.

I've seen other global box-sizing snippets based on a value of
`inherit`, and I strongly advise against it. There are good reasons that
box-related properties like `width`, `padding`, and `box-sizing` don't
inherit the way fonts and colors do. Inheriting layout properties will
only cause problems later.

  [box-model]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model

### Use Padding for Gutters

In reality, grid math is only complex when you add margin-gutters to the
equation. Without gutters in the way, spanning `3` columns out of `12`
is a simple fraction: `percentage(3/12)` in Sass. If you are able to
drop the gutters, or even move them into `padding` rather than
`margins`, you can avoid grid math entirely:

```scss
// With Sass
.simple-grid {
  float: left;
  width: percentage(3/12);
}

/* Without Sass */
.simple-grid {
  float: left;
  width: calc(3/12 * 100%);
}
```

If you want to get really clever, you can build your own grid-system out
of CSS [custom properties] (aka variables):

{{ embed.codepen(
  id='d05d2ea9339419df7070f9c393a9c080',
  title='Calc() + Custom Properties',
  user='mirisuzanne'
) }}

That will also work with css-tables, etc. Add any padding you like, and
you have on-the-fly fluid grids without any third-party tools.

We've even built a nearly-complete Susy3 in pure CSS. This is a fun
experiment, but I don't recommend using it in production:

{{ embed.codepen(
  id='PboVrw',
  title='SusyCSS Demo',
  user='mirisuzanne'
) }}

Susy is designed to handle any layout, but if you are designing grids in
pure CSS, it's better to describe your actual needs more simply. Why
solve all layout problems, when you can solve only the problems you
have?

[custom properties]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*

### Use Flexbox

The great thing about flexbox is that it allows items to flex in
specific relationship with each other, including equal-height columns
and vertical centering. I often find that I don't need Susy for a
flexbox layout, because I'd rather define relationships instead of
explicit grid-columns.

Here's an example flexbox layout, without Susy:

{{ embed.codepen(
  id='657a71f05b9c044d0235bab212abdbdc',
  title='Full-height Flexbox',
  user='mirisuzanne'
) }}

If you do want to use Susy with flexbox to achieve more consistent
grids, you only need to replace any `flex-basis` values with Susy's
`span()` function.

```scss
.flex {
  flex: 1 1 span(3 of 12);
}
```

I can't think of any way to improve that with mixins, unless you want a
few flexing defaults:

```scss
@mixin span(
  $span,
  $config: ()
) {
  flex: 1 1 span($span, $config);
  // split the gutter on each side of the element...
  padding: gutter($span, $config) / 2;
}
```

### Use Calc to Mix Units

Calc can also help you with mixed-unit grids, combining fluid and fixed
columns and gutters. Because `calc` has access to the DOM in the
browser, it can calculate the results of otherwise non-comparable units.
This is a bit more fragile and manual than allowing grid or flexbox to
do that work for you, but it can be a powerful fallback:

{{ embed.codepen(
  id='70b5a2cf411542e74d1cd42d5ddbe446',
  title='Floats with Calc',
  user='mirisuzanne'
) }}

## Introducing Susy3

If you can't simplify your math with padding-gutters and flexbox, you
may still run into some difficult calculations that require complex grid
math.

Susy3 is here to help calculate margin-gutters, asymmetrical grids, and
mixed-unit calculations that are difficult to handle without CSS Grid.
In those cases, Susy can turn this:

```scss
$width: ($span + (($span - 1) * $gutter-width)) / ($columns + (($columns - 1) * $gutter-width));
```

Into something more manageable:

```scss
$width: span(3);
```

## Grids on Demand

One user asked if Susy3 forces you to build "an entire grid system from
scratch". While Susy certainly allows and facilitates that option, we're
really suggesting that you might not need a more complex system when you
can access Susy's math directly, on-the-fly.

The primary API of Susy3 consists of 2 functions, `span` and `gutter`,
which you can use anywhere. Why build an entire system of mixins or
classes when you can simply use these two functions wherever you need to
align with the grid? This is more readable and more flexible than most
grid systems, because no CSS properties are hidden from view:

```scss
// class names are for demonstration only...
.float {
  width: span(3);
  margin-right: gutter();
}

.flexbox {
  flex: 1 1 span(3);
  padding: 0 gutter() / 2;
}

.push-3 {
  margin-left: span(3 wide);
}
```

If you find that too repetitive for your needs, you can build mixins to
manage a few common patterns. Here's a simple `span` mixin for floated
grids, with margin-gutters on the right:

```scss
@mixin span(
  $span,
  $config: $susy
) {
  width: span($span, $config);

  @if index($span, 'last') {
    float: right;
  } @else {
    float: left;
    margin-right: gutter();
  }
}
```

You can also build a class system of your own, like you might find in
other grid frameworks:

```scss
.span {
  float: left;
  margin-right: gutter();

  &:last-child {
    margin-right: 0;
  }
}

@for $span from 1 through length(susy-get('columns')) {
  .span-#{$span} {
    width: span($span);
  }
}
```

Only users with very specific and complicated needs may still want to
"build an entire system" on top of Susy, in which case we'll provide the
syntax and math – but most use-cases should be handled by the functions
we provide.

## Susy3 Configuration

Global settings are still stored in the `$susy` map variable, just like
Susy2, but now we only have four total settings. Here they are, with
their default values:

```scss
$susy: (
  'columns': susy-repeat(4),
  'gutters': 0.25,
  'spread': 'narrow',
  'container-spread': 'narrow',
);
```

We've already introduced you to `columns` and `gutters`, so let's take a
look at the remaining options.

### "Spread" & "Container-Spread"

Spread isn't new in Susy3, though it's never been a global setting
before. Susy2 managed spread for you, depending on a combination of
other settings, like `gutter-position`. We wrote an article last week
[explaining how spread works].

To summarize, there are three spread options, and most people will only
use two of them: `narrow`, `wide`, and (rarely) `wider`.

- A `narrow` spread has one less gutter than columns.
- A `wide` spread has an equal number of columns and gutters.
- A `wider` spread has one more gutter than columns.

Susy needs to know how an element spreads, and also how containers
spread. Note that Susy3 has no single `container` element. Every grid
element acts as a container for its contents. When we talk about
containers in Susy3, we're referring to the parent context for a given
element.

In Susy2, we would generate both spread values based on
`gutter-position`, using roughly this logic:

```scss
// gutter-position: before | after (margins)
$susy: (
  'spread': 'narrow',
  'container-spread': 'narrow',
);

// gutter-position: split (margins)
$susy: (
  'spread': 'narrow',
  'container-spread': 'wide',
);

// gutter-position: inside (padding)
$susy: (
  'spread': 'wide',
  'container-spread': 'wide',
);
```

We also override those options when pushing, pulling, padding, and
bleeding:

```scss
.push-3 {
  margin-left: span(3 wide);
}

.pull-3 {
  margin-left: 0 - span(3 wide);
}

.pad-left-3 {
  padding-left: span(3 wide);
}

.bleed-left-3 {
  margin-left: 0 - span(3 wide);
  padding-left: span(3 wide);
}
```

Susy3 defaults both values to `narrow`, which will work the same as CSS
Grid and most other grid systems. If you're not doing anything special,
you can probably ignore these settings and move on.

Those are great defaults, but there are many reasons to override those
settings on-the-fly to allow more flexibility where gutters are used.
Learning to manage `spread` and `container-spread` in Susy3 will give
you much more control over your layout experience.

## Susy3 Shorthand Syntax

All Susy3 functions draw on the same shorthand syntax in two parts –
separated by the word `of`. The first part describes a **span** `width`,
`location`, and `spread` (in any order):

```scss
// <width> <location> <spread>
$span: 2;
$spread: 3 wide;

// location is only needed with asymmetrical grids
$location: 3 at 2 narrow;
```

You can also span explicit asymmetrical columns, using a column-list
instead of span-count and location:

```scss
// span 120px and one fraction of the container
$span: (120px 1) narrow;
```

The second half of Susy's shorthand describes the **grid-context** – or
available space – with `columns`, `container-spread`, and `gutters` (in
any order). None are required:

```scss
// of <columns> <container-spread> <gutters>
$columns: of susy-repeat(6);
$spread: of (120px 1 1 14em) wide;
$gutters: of 12 set-gutters 2em;
```

As you can see, the `columns` value here is identical to the global
`columns` setting, with one difference. Unlike the global setting,
shorthand column-context can be described as a unitless span-count
rather than a list. A single unitless number for columns will be treated
as a slice of the parent grid:

```scss
// columns: susy-repeat(12, 120px)
$shorthand: of 4;
$meaning: of susy-repeat(4, 120px);
```

If you are using asymmetrical grids, Susy can't slice it for you. We
provide a slice function with exactly the same shorthand syntax, but it
returns a list of columns rather than a calculated width:

```scss
// columns: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
$shorthand: of slice(first 4);
$meaning: of (1 1 2 3);
```

## Primary API Functions

Use the `span()` and `gutter()` functions to build the grid system that
fits you best.

### Span

The `span()` function will return the width of a span across
grid-columns and any intermediate gutters. Apply the results to a
`width` or `flex-basis` property to size your grid elements – or use it
with `padding`, `margin`, and `translateX()` to move your elements
around.

The `span()` mixin only requires a span width, but accepts the full
shorthand:

```scss
// Common Use...
$width: span(3);

// Much less common...
$width: span(first 3 wide of (1 1 2 3 5 8) wide set-gutters 20px);
```

### Gutter

Gutter will return the width of a single gutter, and only accepts the
second half (context) of the shorthand – with or without `of`:

```scss
// Common Use...
$padding: gutter();

// With Context...
$padding: gutter(of 4);
$same-meaning: gutter(4);
```

## Installation & Other Options

There are full installation instructions in the [reference docs], but
you should note that we now provide the Susy API with or without
prefixes:

```scss
// unprefixed
@import '<path-to>/susy/sass/susy';

// prefixed
@import '<path-to>/susy/sass/susy-prefix';
```

By default we assume you want Susy without any prefix, but importing
`susy-prefix` will include `susy-` before all function names. You can
use that if you are worried about name collisions with other functions
in your project.

[reference docs]: /susy/docs/

### SVG grids for debugging

If you want help visualizing and debugging your grids, import the SVG
Grid Plugin:

```scss
// unprefixed
@import '<path-to>/susy/sass/plugins/svg-grid';

// prefixed
@import '<path-to>/susy/sass/plugins/svg-grid/prefix';
```

The plugin adds an `svg-grid-colors` setting to your global defaults,
which you can override in the `$susy` settings map. It also provides you
with a new function, `susy-svg-grid()`, which will return an inline svg
image for use on the background of an element:

```scss
.container {
  background: susy-svg-grid() no-repeat scroll;
}
```

SVG grids are much more reliable than the old background-image gradient,
because background gradients have subpixel rounding issues.

### Building your own Susy system

Once you get the basics, Susy3 also provides tools to help you build
your own mixins and define your own system, if that's something you
need. See the [Plugin Utilities] for more detail.

## Feedback is Always Welcome

We know we're taking some risks with this release, not providing what
most people expect from a grid system. Some may prefer working with
Susy2, and that's a solid option as well. Over time, we hope the CSS
Grid module will replace all third-party systems.

While we're confident that this is a step forward for Susy, we never
claim to know what's best for you. We'd love your feedback, and
real-world examples of how you make Susy work for you.
