## Don'ts

Paul, a developer at Google, starts with the don'ts. Don't use scroll
events to create a parallax effect.

Trying to achieve a parallax look by changing background position
doesn't work well either, negatively effecting the animation.

## CSS 3D

Paul recommends using CSS 3D for performant parallaxing, and gives
detailed instructions for how to do just that. Anticipating the bugs for
us, Paul includes various workarounds.
