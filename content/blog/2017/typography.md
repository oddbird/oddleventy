How do you choose the best fonts for a brand identity among the
thousands of options available on the interwebs these days – typography
that perfectly expresses the mood you or your client want to evoke when
users encounter your company – while also meeting accessibility
standards, and standing out from the masses? OddBird tackled this
question as part of the [open redesign process] of this, our OddSite.

Whether you’re starting from scratch or rebranding like us, this
step-by-step guide can help direct your process. I’m focusing on website
branding, but many of these ideas apply to print as well. If you already
have typography, but you need a beautiful color palette, check out this
guide to [choosing brand colors for your website].

## Step 1 – Define Brand Goals

It’s hard to know whether you’ve found what you’re looking for unless
you first know what you’re looking for. Ask yourself or your client
questions like these: What is the personality/attitude of the project?
What is it *not*?

After a review of our [OddSite Brand Goals], we knew we were looking for
type families that conjured the ideas of trustworthiness, skill and high
standards without arrogance or that rectangular corporate look. All of
that plus a dash of our odd, people-first personality (though we agreed
any typeface termed cute or flashy would be going too far).

## Step 2 – Play with Typography Options and Typeface Pairings

Now the fun part! Typography is a delight, and there are so many choices
with unique associations and histories and uses. Serifs make long chunks
of small text easier to read. Typefaces like Times New Roman, Georgia,
and Baskerville have been around forever and are often used to present
serious news. Associations like classic and trustworthy spring to mind.
According to a [study by Errol Morris], “Baskerville, a 250-year-old
serif...was statistically more likely to influence the minds of readers
than Computer Modern, Georgia, Helvetica, Comic Sans or Trebuchet.”

On the other hand sans serif, hand-drawn typefaces like Amatic SC are
personal and friendly and bring to mind trendy indie movies: *Life
Inside Out*, *Frank*. Amatic shines in titling, but would make my brain
hurt if I had to read several paragraphs at 14px size. Always check the
description for each typeface to find out what it was designed for and
whether it is accessible at small sizes.

Dive deep and luxuriate.

### 7 Resources – Free and High Quality Typography and Typeface Pairing

## [Font Squirrel]

Font Squirrel is my go-to resource for typography. Curated for quality
and free for commercial use, Font Squirrel’s compilation of typefaces is
easy to filter and download.

## [Fontspring]

If you can’t find the perfect typeface on Font Squirrel, try its sister
site Fontspring. Their lists of thousands of high quality typefaces
aren’t free, but Fontspring has done the mind numbing work of sorting
through licenses to make the purchasing process straightforward and easy
to understand for you and your clients. Proxima Nova is a personal
favorite that OddBird used for the [CoachHub app].

## [Adobe TypeKit]

If you already have an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription, then you can
use TypeKit fonts in your Adobe software and commercial web and/or print
projects. Double check the [licensing details] before presenting a
TypeKit font option to a client. You may find some TypeKit fonts
available for free on Google Fonts or you may run into expensive and
complex license restrictions.

Since OddBird already subscribes to Creative Cloud, I found several font
options there: Freight Sans and Freight Text, Abril and Raleway,
Merriweather and PT Sans. Not all of these typefaces made it to our
final round of element collages, but it was an excellent place to start.
[TypeKit Design Gallery] is an inspiration for typeface pairing as well.

## [Google Fonts]

Google Fonts’ collection of free, open source typefaces is an excellent
resource. These fonts are all designed for the web, so you can be sure
you’re getting a legible, high quality typeface. I love reading about
the foundries and designers who designed each typeface and why. These
descriptions are a handy resource when you need to explain to clients
how your typeface choices relate back to their brand goals. Google Fonts
also offers typeface pairing suggestions with each specimen.

## [Typewolf]

Typewolf is the first place I go to find lovely typeface pairing with
samples from live websites as well as expert recommendations. I
discovered Freight Sans and Freight Text on Typewolf.

## [Font Pair]

Font Pair is exclusively for pairings of Google Fonts. I love the
stripped down design. This is where I found the Raleway and Merriweather
typeface pairing, one option we considered for OddSite. Unfortunately,
this pair didn’t make the final round of cuts.

## [Carrie Dils]

I found Carrie’s blog on TypeKit typeface pairing to be a very
informative and hilarious read. She provides intriguing insight into why
her pairings work well together.

## Step 3 – Test Typography and Pairings in Context

I can spend hours browsing typography websites. To really evaluate
whether a particular typeface will work for your project, I strongly
recommend testing it in the context of your logo or website. Try out
various weights – bold, italic, condensed – and sizes.

> In many ways, the font size is not as important as it used to be,
> because of the increased customizability of browsers and assistive
> technologies. However, it is important that your design accommodate
> increased text sizes without loss of readability or functionality.
>

Additionally, avoid using all caps wherever possible. It’s more
difficult to read. Plus, **IT LOOKS LIKE YOU’RE SHOUTING**.

OddBird borrowed ideas from [Vox Product’s] process to test our
typography options. Our design team created typography element collages,
each using the same content from our blog. Presenting different typeface
families in the same context also made it easier for the rest of the
Birds to evaluate the options.

Stacy, Miriam, and myself (Sondra), the three OddBird designers, each
designed two or three element collages. Then we met and eliminated all
but the best four before presenting to the rest of the [Birds]. Each of
the collages featured serif fonts – trustworthiness is a brand goal –
with a twist.

## Step 4 – Vote Remotely Using...GitHub?

All the options are so amazing for different reasons. How do you narrow
to just one typeface or a single pair? (And narrowing down is important
for accessibility.)

> Using too many font faces can create a confusing visual layout, which
> is bad for all users, but may be especially difficult for users with
> reading disorders, learning disabilities, or attention deficit
> disorders.
>
> --[WebAIM]

To keep the process moving forward, it helps to take a vote. There are
many ways to take a vote. [Dotmocracy] is a classic for team voting.

The Birds are spread out across five states and three time zones, and
while we love dot-voting, we needed a web tool to help out. We also
wanted our [OddFriends Slack channel] members to weigh in. After looking
at several apps, we decided to try using [GitHub Issues] comments and
emoji reactions. Everyone got two votes and the process worked
brilliantly with the winning typefaces receiving six thumbs up.

## Pros and Cons of Freight Sans and Freight Text Font Pair

And the winning pair is...

OddBird chose Freight Sans for headlines and Freight Text for the body.
Fun without being flashy. Professional without being stuffy. Trustworthy
yet odd. Easy to read at a broad range of sizes. These typefaces embody
the essence of OddBird. Being from the same foundry and family, the
visual harmony is effortless.

![image][11]

Warmth, authority, helpfulness: a very accurate description of what
OddBird would like our users to experience when they work with us and
land on OddSite making Freight Sans an obvious choice to meet our brand
goals.

> Freight Text series was designed for extended reading in periodicals
> and data-intensive documents.
>
> --[Typedia]

Freight Text was originally developed for print, and we love the classic
feel this evokes, but it’s also very easy to read online, especially for
large chunks of text like this blog post. Freight Text italics reminds
us a bit of Libre Baskerville – the font OddBird used previously, but
Freight Text has a little something extra – rounded edges, subtle
flourishes – that sets it apart. Unfortunately, Freight Text lacks an
amazing ampersand, so we intend to [create a custom font stack] and
continue using Baskerville’s ampersand.

Also, we’re suckers for fonts with lowercase numerals.

![image][12]

Freight was developed by [Darden Studio] and is available at [Phil’s
Fonts] as well as through TypeKit. Without a TypeKit subscription, the
Freight licenses may have been more of a hassle than we wanted to deal
with, requiring monthly pageview tracking. With TypeKit, we were golden.

## Getting Personal

I've loved typography since I was very young. Just for fun, here's my
first hand-drawn alphabet from fifth grade.
