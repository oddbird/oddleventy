summary: |
  If you’ve ever found yourself in a specificity war, you’ll understand how
  important having control over style priority can be. During our conversation,
  we discussed what CSS Layers are and how you may use them in your project.

## What we cover:

- What is the cascade, and why is it important in CSS
- How we historically dealt with cascade/specificity problems (before layers)
- What CSS Layers are and how they work
- Why unlayered styles are prioritized
- How to start using Layers within a project
- Additional best practices when using Layers

We also chat about what's new in CSS including new color tools, `:has`, scope,
nesting, and more.
