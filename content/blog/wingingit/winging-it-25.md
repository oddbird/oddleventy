summary: |
  OddBirds, Stacy and Sondra,
  along with special guest
  [Clayton Dewey](https://devcollaborative.com/about-us/clayton-dewey)
  of Dev Collaborative,
  face off against
  bad UX design patterns.
  They get into the weeds
  trying to address
  some of the thorniest,
  perennial UX design questions -
  managing complex navigation,
  intuitive user flow,
  is there such a thing
  as a good toggle design,
  and more.

## What We Cover:

### Complex Navigation
- OddBird's complex navigation and disperate audiences
- Defining web "objects" with OOUX philosophy
- How to prioritize the navigation people need most
- Are mega menus ever a good idea?
- Mobile navigation that doesn't bury important content
- Avoiding nebulous naming
- OddBird's current navigation solution
- "Don't make me think."
- Vitaly’s Idea: Query the user's intent rather than making assumptions

### Intuitive User Flow
- DevCollab's user flow and many services
- Content strategy process
- Card sorting with clients to get user feedback

### UX Design Speed Round
- Is there ever a case for infinite scroll?
- Pagination or Load More button?
- Is there such a thing as a good toggle button design?
- Click to open or hover?
- IDs on headers and click to copy
- Is it a button or a link?
- Should a link open in the same window or a new window?
- Down with autoplay!
- Truncatio...
- Forms with unclear error messages
- Bad Apple remote interface design
