summary: |
  Web Components are a polarizing feature
  that seem simultaneously old news
  and not quite ready for production yet.
  But we’ve been making things with Web Components,
  and finding some areas where they really work well.
  Join us,
  along with special guest [Zach Leatherman](https://www.zachleat.com/)
  of [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/),
  to hear more about how we’re using them,
  what they work well for,
  and why we’re excited about them.
