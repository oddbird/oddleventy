summary: |
  Join Miriam Suzanne, Stacy Kvernmo,
  and special guest
  [Alan Stearns](https://github.com/astearns)
  – typography enthusiast, co-chair
  of the CSS Working Group,
  and self-described CSS Panjandrum
  – for a conversation about typography.

  Responsive Typography has been around
  for at least a decade in various forms,
  but has become even more popular
  with tools like Utopia.fyi, Fluid.style, Typetura,
  and more – all relying
  on the latest CSS units and math functions.
  But there are still a lot of questions worth asking.

  subscribe_url
) }}
 ## What we cover:
- What do users really want when they change the default browser font size?
- Is it appropriate for padding and margins to grow along with text?
- What all should we be responding to, and can CSS do what’s required?
