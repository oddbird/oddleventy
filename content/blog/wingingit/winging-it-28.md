summary: |
  At the end of 2025,
  Firefox added the CSS `@scope` rule –
  making the new feature available
  across all major browsers!
  Since [Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net) has done
  a fair amount of writing
  and speaking on the topic,
  we wanted to talk with him
  about what that means.
  Chris has also been writing
  about the future of CSS Mixins,
  a new specification
  Miriam is working on.
  We answer questions,
  get feedback,
  and chat about where CSS is heading.
