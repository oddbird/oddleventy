  On December 17, 1996
  the W3C published the first standard for CSS,
  and we celebrated on Winging It!
  [Michelle Barker](https://michellebarker.co.uk/), [Stephanie Eckles](https://thinkdobecreate.com/),
  [Kevin Powell](https://www.kevinpowell.co/), and [Henri Helvetica](https://bsky.app/profile/henrihelvetica.bsky.social)
  joined us for our "CSS Is Awesome Game".
  If you love CSS as much as we do,
  we hope you will play along
  as we battle it out
  to see who is AWESOME.
