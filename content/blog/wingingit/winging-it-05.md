summary: |
  Join us for a dynamic exploration of FastAPI,
  a modern Python framework for API development.
  We kick off with a clear explanation of FastAPI
  and its standout features,
  then move into error handling
  and data validation.
  We also delve into OpenAPI’s role
  in managing endpoints
  and the perks of automated documentation.
