  With the release of kanban-style project boards, we decided to move our
  open design process over to GitHub and give it a try.

[GitHub] recently released a set of new [project-management features],
including improved code-reviews and [kanban]-style "project" boards for
prioritizing issues, and visualizing progress.

We've been using [Pivotal Tracker] for a long time now, and it works
well for us, but we decided to try out GitHub Projects for our [OddSite
Open Design] process.

My first impressions are mixed. There's a lot to like about these new
features, and the ability to organize issues â€“ but the flow doesn't feel
well-integrated yet. We'll write about the experience in more detail
once we've had more time to live with it.
