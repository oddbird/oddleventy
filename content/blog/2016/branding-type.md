What follows is an in-depth look at our brand design process thus far as
we work towards a new look and feel for this, our OddSite. Details,
confessions, what worked, what flopped, and why.

If you make it all the way through to the end, we’re hoping you’ll give
us your opinions on an important question. (Go ahead. Scroll to the end.
We’ll wait here.)

## Where We Began

In the spring of this year at our bi-annual work retreat, OddBird
decided to grow our company to six people. In order to grow, we needed a
website that would more clearly articulate our design process and
development services to potential clients. After [Defining Goals and
Exploring Possibilities] we identified the people we’d like to reach
with OddSite – entrepreneurs with new software ideas and other web
developers in our community – and decided that an open website redesign
process would be one way to inspire and engage those users. In reality
we’ve been moving slowly, distracted by client work. We’ll keep giving
it as much attention as we can!

First, we mapped out a content flow, so Miriam and Stacy could build the
basic site architecture that you see now. Next, we needed a brand.
Little did we know the struggles we would encounter, the rag-clad
wizards who would point the way out of the thicket, or the new tools we
would gain for our questing satchels... (I’m in the middle of writing a
fantasy novel. My apologies.)

## An Odd Logo

In 2008 when OddBird launched, Miriam designed the OddBird logo. It’s
gone through some small adjustments, but we still love our odd orange
egg-wing friend, so we’re sticking with it. The text behind the bird is
up for grabs, though, as we consider what typography best suits the
overall site. More on that below.


## The Birds: Design Team

[Miriam], [Sondra], and [Stacy] are the OddBird design team. Each of us
brought years of varied experience, methods, tools, and questions. This
would be Miriam’s and Sondra’s first time working on brand design with
Stacy, and we were all excited to get started!

## Element Collages, Moodboards, and Style Tiles? Oh my!

At our fall work retreat, the full OddBird team met with a business
development professional who helped us further clarify and confirm our
brand goals. The design team spent time individually looking at the
brand elements of our favorite websites and sites with similar goals. We
came back together for a show-and-tell, first among ourselves, and then
with a brief overview of our findings and ideas for the full team.
That’s when we ran into a big question about our process.

Do we create element collages, mood boards, or style tiles to take these
general brand ideas to the next stage? We each had successful
experiences using all of these methods to create brands for clients, and
we went back and forth about which one would work best for us.

**Mood Boards:** A [mood board] is a collection of elements such as
text, images, colors, textures, and styles that convey a particular look
and feel or mood for a web project. Talking through several mood boards
with a client can be an excellent place to start when you need to pick a
fairly general brand direction.

**Style Tiles:**

The genius of style tiles is the way they define a middle ground – more
specific than a mood board and more open for interpretation than a full
mockup. Samantha Warren wrote an excellent article for A List Apart
called [Style Tiles and How They Work].

**Element Collages:** Element collages focus on brand design for a set
of elements grouped together, a form, for example. Element collages are
quicker to design than full mockups, but detailed enough to help a
client visualize an implemented brand. Daniel Mall goes into detail on
[Element Collages] on his blog.

The design team struggled with which technique would be most useful for
our internal design process. There were too many elements to consider at
once in our element collages, and we were loath to use the blender
method of mixing and matching, but neither did we feel that any one
element collage encapsulated our brand. We tried style tiles, but those
felt both too specific and not specific enough.

Sometimes tools that worked before don't work for a new team or project.
Fortunately, we remembered that getting stuck isn't a failure. Good
process doesn't mean ideas always flow smoothly, without ever going down
the wrong path. Our goal isn't to foresee and avoid every problem, but
to recognize when we're getting stuck, and have the tools available to
try a different approach.

So we looked to our community for inspiration. Stacy posted a fantastic
article from [Vox Product] detailing their brand design process. When
their design team got to the step we reached, they wisely picked a
single element to focus on: typography.

## Typography - With a Little Help From Our Friends

Our three designers each created several designs – basically element
collages – of a blogpost. We picked the blogpost for two reasons: it is
text heavy, and it is also the core of our new website design. We want
to be an education source for the web community, part of a conversation
with you. Our blog is an essential conversation starter, so it is
important for us to design it well. Focusing on just one element,
typography, clarified the conversation, and we’ve narrowed the selection
to our top three typefaces.

During our conversations about typography so far, the design team
settled on a couple elements that fit our brand well.

**Break Rectangles:** In all of our styles you’ll see us using text to
create uneven or rounded edges. By breaking the column in surprising,
yet tasteful ways we aim to express our oddness without being overly
cute.

**Classic Serif:** We like the classic look of the serif font for body
text as it brings to mind newspapers and books creating a timeless,
almost tactile feel. We want to convey honesty and thoughtfulness with
our brand and classic serif fonts like Baskerville are known for
communicating trustworthiness.

And this is where you come in. We’re having a conversation on our
[OddFriends Slack channel], and we want to hear from you. There are
other design elements, but we are only interested here in choosing the
new OddSite typeface. Please weigh in with your opinions and thoughts
and things you’ve learned the hard way. If we didn’t know it before,
this OddSite brand design process has proven how dependent we are on
each other to do this business of web design to the best of our
abilities. Thanks!
