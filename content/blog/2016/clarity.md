It was an honor to be part of the first ever [Clarity Conference] in San
Francisco – a beautiful event organized by [Jina], and completely
focussed on Style Guides.

[Chris Coyier] and [Brad Frost] both posted extensive notes on all the
speakers, and I recommend reading them.

I talked about the [code patterns] we use to represent design patterns,
especially in our front-end Sass, HTML (Jinja?), and JavaScript code.
