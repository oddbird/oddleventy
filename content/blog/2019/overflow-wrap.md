summary: |
  Horizontal text overflow has always been difficult to manage on the web.
  The default visible overflow is designed to make sure content remains
  accessible no matter the size of a containing box, but it's not our only
  option.

We can now use `overflow-wrap` to control how words break --and combine
that with hyphens to make wrapped text more readable. The solutions
aren't perfect yet, but I'll walk you through the options we have, and
how to use them.
