Donate to the [Ada Initiative] today to support women in open
technology and culture. If we hit **\$10,000** by Friday, [Jacob] and
[Alex] and [Jim Meyer] and I will match your donations to make it a nice
round **\$20k**. Life is short, go donate now!

(**Update**: Shortly after we announced this drive, [Jim Meyer][]
[pitched in] to raise the match amount from $7500 to $10,000! Awesome!)

I've spent most of my working life with Python and open technology.
Python and open source have been good to me. They've helped me [start a
company], [become a public speaker], be [recognized for my
contributions], and make friends all over the world.

I attended my first PyCon in 2008, and I've been to every one since. I
gave my [first PyCon talk] in 2011. That year, 1% of the talks were by
women; ninety-five out of ninety-six by men. Being one of those
ninety-five helped me to launch a career in open source software.
Ninety-odd other men got that same opportunity that year; one woman did.

Three years later, thanks to the incredible outreach efforts of Jessica
McKellar, the amazing [PyLadies], the Ada Initiative, and many others,
women gave a **full third** of the talks at PyCon 2014.

I have two sons, a seven-year-old and a four-month-old (yep, that's
him). With the second just arrived, I think a lot these days about the
work I do. I want it to be work that will make them proud, that I will
be happy to tell them about.

I am ashamed to admit to being part of this industry when I see Kathy
Sierra or Adria Richards or Anita Sarkeesian or [Zoe Quinn] or [any
number of other women] systematically harassed, threatened, and attacked
by gangs of abusive men for the crime of speaking their minds as women.

</div>

I am ashamed to be part of this industry because of [pervasive sexual
harassment] and sexism at tech conferences, in the workplace, and at
meetups.

I want to be able to wholeheartedly celebrate my successes and recommend
open source software communities, but I know that I've been [playing on
the easy setting][]: paid more and presumed competent because of my
gender, skin color, cultural similarity to those in positions of power,
and [other attributes that I did nothing to earn].

But I know we can change our industry. I'm proud to be a part of the
Python community when I see it [leading] the [way] in working towards
being welcoming to people who don't all look, talk, and act like me. I'm
happy to be in the Python community (and humbled by all the hard work it
took to get here) when I see this:

> Hello from your [@PyCon](https://twitter.com/pycon)

I'm proud to be part of the Django community when we adopt a strong
[Code of Conduct] (in consultation with Ada Initiative!), and when
["that time I wasn't harassed at a conference"] is a description of
DjangoCon.

That's the community that I want to be a part of, and the Ada Initiative
is [working every day] to [make it a reality]. If that's the community
you want too, join me and donate today!

Thanks for listening,

Carl
