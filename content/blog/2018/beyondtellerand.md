summary: |
  I love when conferences give me the opportunity to travel around the world.
  I love it even more when conferences go beyond the web to find inspiration from
  other fields. [Beyond Tellerand] (Düsseldorf, Germany) was the best possible
  combination.

Right from the start, Beyond Tellerand was unlike other conferences.
Rather than hearing familiar talks about familiar technology, the first
day took us on a journey through web annotations, intricate
illustrations, design for non-designers, robots with personality,
stop-motion tinkering, and programatically-generated art.

I spoke on day two, followed by "bleeding edge" accessibility,
large-scale projection-mapping, the women who built the internet, and a
lesson on ethics in tech. How could I even begin to match the
inspirational scope of these other presenters, while talking about
layout?

I couldn't -- but I did have some fun. Inspired by the generated art from
Jared Tarbell and the [Levitated Toy Factory], I picked [one of his art
pieces] to recreate with CSS variables (aka custom properties) and CSS
grid layouts.

I spent that evening studying his image, and translating it into HTML
and CSS. My first draft relied heavily on `:nth-child()` selectors,
leading to an absurd 3MB CSS file. By adding custom properties in the
HTML, I was able to streamline things dramatically. This [second draft]
relies on HAML to generate the required HTML for a static (but
responsive) result.

That went over well at the conference, but I decided to improve it after
the conference was over. By moving the component logic into [Vue], I
could interact with the controls dynamically -- and animate the changes:
shuffling, resizing, and more. Finally, I pulled in an
Asteroids-inspired browser snippet so you can destroy your creation.
Enjoy the invasion!
