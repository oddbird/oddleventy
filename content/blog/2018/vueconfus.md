summary: |
  I've been excited about [Vue.js] since [Sarah Drasner] first showed me
  the basics. Since then, we've started using it for client work at
  OddBird, and I'm constantly impressed by the power and simplicity -- so
  it was a real honor being invited to speak at the first [VueConf US] in
  New Orleans.

I enjoyed the conference as much as I enjoy the framework. I was
particularly impressed with the way core team members talk about
community and future development. Everyone was welcoming, interested in
my contributions, and helpful when I had questions. Several of the core
team members are now helping us build Vue component documentation into
[Herman], our style guide generator.

I was also able to attend Sarah's full-day Vue animation workshop. If
you ever have the chance to learn from Sarah, I highly recommend it. I
was already using the Vue `<transition>` and `<transition-group>`
[built-in functionality] on projects, but not to their full extent.
Revisiting an internal OddBird project, still in early development, I
was finally able to create the page transitions that I wanted all along.

All the [VueConf talks] are available online, and I recommend checking
them out!
