  title: Help Us Make Logical Shorthands a Reality
  summary: |
    The CSS Working Group recently resolved to add a size shorthand for setting
    both the width and height of an element. Many people asked about using it to
    set the ‘logical’ inline-size and block-size properties instead. But ‘logical
    shorthands’ have been stalled in the working group for years. Can we get them
    unstuck?
summary: |
  Since we began, OddBird has contributed to open tools & standards — **focusing
  lately on CSS** and related platform features with Miriam joining the W3C as
  an Invited Expert. **That work takes resources**, making it hard for
  independent contributors like us to stay involved. If you appreciate our work,
  **you (or your company) can sponsor** us directly.
