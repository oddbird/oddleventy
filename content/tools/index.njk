  title: Support Logical Shorthands in CSS

  cta: Sponsor our work on logical shorthands »
  summary: |
    The CSS Working Group recently resolved
    to add a `size` shorthand for setting
    both the `width` and `height` of an element.
    Many people asked about using it to set the 'logical'
    `inline-size` and `block-size` properties instead.
    But 'logical shorthands' have been stalled
    in the working group for years.

    With a little funding, we could make it happen!

  Since we began, OddBird has contributed to open tools & standards — **focusing
  lately on CSS** and related platform features with Miriam joining the W3C as
  an Invited Expert. **That work takes resources**, making it hard for
  independent contributors like us to stay involved. If you appreciate our work,
  **you (or your company) can sponsor** us directly.
