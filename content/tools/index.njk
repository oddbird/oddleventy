summary: |
  Since we began, OddBird has contributed to open tools & standards — **focusing lately on CSS** and related platform features with Miriam joining the W3C as an Invited Expert. **That work takes resources**, making it hard for independent contributors like us to stay involved. If you appreciate our work, **you (or your company) can sponsor** us directly.
