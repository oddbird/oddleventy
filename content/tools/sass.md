  Miriam became a core contributor to the language.

Over the years,
we've developed a number of Sass-based
open source tools:

- [Susy](/susy/) was a popular layout system
  before CSS introduced grids
- [True](/true/) is still the most widely used Sass unit-testing framework
- [Accoutrement](/accoutrement/) & [Herman](/herman/)
  help manage and document design systems
- [Cascading Colors](/cascading-colors/)
  provide user interactions for site color palettes
- [Blend](/blend/)
  helped polyfill modern color syntax in Sass

More recently, the entire OddBird team
contracted with Google
to design and implement [high-priority Sass features][core],
and [re-build the website][site]
with a new [Sass playground][playground].
