      Herman is my documentation dream come true,
      especially when it comes to systems design.

summary: |
 **[Design systems] streamline development, communication, and consistency** --
  but often rely on dedicated teams and extended budgets.
  We wanted a tool that helps create and maintain living style guides &
  pattern libraries in an agile process, and on a budget. Herman helps you
  keep your development process simple --
  and your UX consistent --
  as you scale over time.

## Give Your Design System a Home

Documentation should be the default option -- the path of least
resistance for developers. Herman combines documentation of design
tokens and system guidelines, with code patterns, components, and
rendered visual examples -- all driven by Sass and CSS. By automating as
much of the documentation as possible, you can help ensure that
everything stays up-to-date for long-term maintainability.

Help improve communication across stakeholders, with consistency in UX,
performance, and accessibility -- while reducing technical debt and
minimizing long-term maintenance. Herman is designed to grow with you,
and keep everything in one place.

### Herman's Current Features

- Supports all [SassDoc] annotations and configuration settings
- Integrated with Sass/CSS for better automation
- Visualize design tokens like fonts, colors, sizes, ratios, and icons
- Display Sass mixins and [Nunjucks] macros with expected input and
  rendered examples
- Include additional prose, pages, and links to third-party docs
- Encourage self-documenting patterns, without locking yourself in
- Optionally integrate with OddBird's [Sass Accoutrement] libraries
