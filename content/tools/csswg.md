  Miriam is an Invited Expert
  on the W3C CSS Working Group,
  helping to develop the next level of
  Cascading & Inheritance,
  in addition to other CSS standards.
---

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are the design language of the web --
allowing authors and users to attach style
(fonts, spacing, filter effects, style animations, and more)
to structured documents and Web applications.
By separating the presentation style from the content,
CSS simplifies Web authoring and site maintenance.

Miriam is an editor on several specifications,
and has lead the standardization of
many popular CSS features
since joining the group in 2020:

- [CSS Cascading & Inheritance](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-cascade-6/)
  now defines both _cascade layers_ and _scope_.
- [CSS Conditional Rules](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-conditional-5/)
  now defines size, style, and state
  _container queries_.
  (previously in CSS Containment).
- [CSS Values and Units](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values-5/)
  now defines `progress()`
  and related _interpolation functions_
  for creating more dynamic and responsive CSS.
- [CSS Mixins & Functions](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-mixins-1/)
  is a new module for
  author-defined functions and mixins.

All my research, explainers, and proposals
are available at [css.oddbird.net](https://css.oddbird.net/).
