## Support for Newer Color Formats and Spaces

In additional to Oklch, Oklab, and P3, OddContrast also includes hex, HSL, Lab,
LCH, and sRGB. Enter a color from the available color formats and convert it to
any other supported format. OddContrast provides an alert if the color you
entered is out of gamut for a given color space. Adjust the sliders until your
desired color is back in gamut.

## Contrast Checker for Accessibility

OddContrast checks the contrast ratio between two colors and displays pass or
fail information based on the WCAG 2 accessibility standards for AA and AAA in
normal and large font sizes. If you need a reminder of the contrast ratio
requirements or what font size qualifies as large, OddContrast provides helpful
tips and a link to learn more.

    failing for AA Normal, AAA Normal, and AAA Large font sizes,
    but passing for AA Large font size'
) }}
