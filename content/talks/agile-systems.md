  **Style Guides & Pattern Libraries are great tools**
  for documenting the relationships between code and design,
  but beautiful docs are only half the battle.

We don’t all have dedicated teams and budgets
to build a centralized system.
How can we build patterns into our code,
using templates and pre-processors to iterate and automate
living design systems in an agile and integrated process?

- Using templates and pre-processors for pattern-making in CSS and HTML.
- Designing and integrating toolkits that force pattern-making.
- Examples of what we’ve done, where we’ve failed, and where were headed.
