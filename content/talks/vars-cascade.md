summary: |
  The Cascade makes CSS unique as a language –
  forcing us to revisit
  even the most common programming feature: the variable.

We might think that CSS variables (custom properties)
simply replace Sass or other pre-processors,
but the reality is much more interesting.
Cascading variables open up a range of new possibilities,
and can even be turned back on the cascade itself!
We’ll look at how cascading variables work,
and a full range of practical use-cases that are totally unique to CSS.
