  New CSS proposals like Container Queries,
  Cascade Layers, Scoped Styles, and Nesting
  are all aimed at improving the way we write
  responsive components and design systems.

Over the last decade
Object-Oriented & Responsive design
have become the norm --
with tools like Flexbox, Grid,
intrinsic sizing, and `aspect-ratio`
giving us even more layout control.
CSS has always been designed for a responsive web,
but that goalpost can shift over time.
Join Miriam to explore how these new features
help us write more modern, encapsulated,
and responsive CSS.
