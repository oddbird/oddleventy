summary: |
  **For far too long we've been forced to reuse layout patterns** that
  have worked in the past, creating a web full of sites that all look the
  same. Narrow timelines, browser support restrictions and lack of a true
  grid systems have led us to create work that is "good enough".

[Stacy] spent years exploring how we can make the web a more unique
space. With some of the newer CSS techniques available, we can start to
make more creative designs. CSS Grid Layout is on the horizon and will
play a major role in the design of our sites. Finally having a true, 2
dimensional grid will give our layouts much more flexibility and it is
on us to explore the possibilities.
