summary: |
  **Come check out some battle-tested tools for improving your Python
  testing.** I'll demonstrate intermediate and advanced features of
  py.test (fixtures, parametrized tests), testing web applications with
  WebTest, testing across a matrix of multiple Python and dependency
  versions with tox, writing test doubles, stubs, and spies with mock and
  pretend, and measuring code coverage with coverage.py.
