**As creators, it’s tempting to grab and consolidate our power**,
but sometimes the medium or audience has a different opinion.
Maybe we’ll look at my experiences of chaos
as a professional web developer and mixed-media artist –
what’s worked and what hasn’t.
Maybe we’ll talk about differences in media, or how they mix.
Maybe we’ll talk about the performative turn,
or some other academic jargon.
Maybe we’ll get way off topic.
These things are hard to predict.
