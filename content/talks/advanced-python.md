summary: |
  **Come along for a tour of Python's more advanced features:**
  decorators, context managers, descriptors, iterators, generators, and
  metaclasses. We'll look at several examples of each in real use, and
  understand the benefits the feature brings over other approaches. We'll
  also discuss what problems you might (or might not) want to reach for
  each of them as a solution to.
