summary: |
  **Got some code that you've written that would be useful to others**,
  but actually releasing it feels like too much new stuff to figure out?
  Releasing software does take some work, but this talk will take you
  step-by-step through the process with specific recommendations and
  tools. We'll cover preparing your code for release, packaging it,
  releasing it, and maintaining it over time.

There are a lot of things to think about when releasing code to the
world, if you want others to be able to use it and contribute back.
We'll cover:

- The structure of an open-source Python project
- Choosing a license
- Documentation with Sphinx and ReadTheDocs
- Multi-version testing with Tox, coverage measurement with
  coverage.py, and continuous integration with TravisCI
- Writing a setup.py and releasing to PyPI
- Semantic versioning
- Helping people contribute to your project
