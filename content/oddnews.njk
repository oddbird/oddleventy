      To learn from Miriam
      is truly a privilege,
      not only because
      she is involved in writing specifications,
      but because,
      at the end of the day,
      she is also a developer like us.
      This puts her
      in a unique position
      to help you understand
      not only how to use CSS,
      but also to understand why
      it works the way it does.

      James helped me get my head around anchor positioning quickly. After he
      explained it to me I was able to put anchor positioning to work in a
      project immediately, in a way that I would have previously solved with
      lots of custom JavaScript and headaches. If you want to learn anchor
      positioning in a fast and practical way, there's no one better than James
      to teach you.
