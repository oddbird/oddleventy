<h2>Hi, I'm Miriam</h2>

I co-founded OddBird with my brothers in 2008
as a **full-stack, boutique agency**
to provide **custom web application design & development,**
along with **refactors** for integrated
**design systems, accessibility, performance, and long-term sustainability**.

Since then OddBird has become an industry leader --
from our work on Django, Sass, and Susy,
to the **CSS Working Group, Mozilla Developer Channel, Object Oriented UX,**
and in-depth conference talks on **front-end architecture,** workflow,
**component libraries,** testing, and **documentation**.

We'd love to help you thoughtfully **serve people with technology**.
