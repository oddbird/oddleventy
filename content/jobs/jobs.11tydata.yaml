    ## At OddBird, We:

    - Are a small team (currently {{ team_size }})
    - Enjoy working collaboratively on complex problems
    - Collectively set the vision & direction of the company:
      how we work, who we work for, and how we manage resources
    - Pay ourselves a competitive hourly rate,
      equally across the entire team,
      with total transparency
    - Are free to take on tasks and explore roles
      beyond the initial job posting
      (if you have other skills & interests, we want to know about them!)
    - All contribute to writing and reviewing documentation
    - Give and receive design critiques and code reviews as collaborators
    - Have lives & interests outside of work
    - Set our own hours, and work remote
      (UTC-4 to UTC-8 most of the time, but trips further afield are fine!)
    - Listen to users, and enjoy having our assumptions challenged/tested
    - Care about diversity in the tech community
      and in our own work
    - Maintain and enforce a [code of conduct](/conduct/)
      for everyone involved with OddBird work
    - Care about the accessibility of our projects
    - Are engaged in the software community --
      writing articles, sharing tools, and giving talks --
      and pay ourselves for that work

    ## Compensation:

    This isn't a cubicle job with dental, a 401k, and paid vacation.
    We're also not a start-up
    expecting you to work nights and weekends towards future equity.
    This is a contract job with long term potential,
    a good hourly rate, a collective vision, and a lot of flexibility.
    We work together to find clients,
    and we work together to build them the best tools we can.
    When there's work to be done,
    we all do what we can,
    and we get paid for our time.

    Weâ€™re looking for
    **{{ hours }} billable hours per week**
    to start,
    with potential for more.

    Note that contract hours & rates
    don't map cleanly to a 40hr work week.
    Our most active members rarely bill
    more than 30 hours in a week.
    Both our external and internal rates
    (what we charge clients, and what we pay ourselves)
    are set collaboratively as a team,
    and change over time.

    what we're offering,
    and what we expect from you --

    [OddBirding Guide](/quickstart/).
