title: Code of Conduct
summary: |
  As a company, we want to embrace the very differences that have made
  our collaboration successful, and work together to provide the best
  environment for learning, growing, working, and sharing ideas. It is
  imperative that OddBird continue to be a welcoming, challenging, fun,
  and fair place to work.
---

OddBird is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for
everyone – regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or
religion. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. If you are being
harassed by an OddBird contributor, notice that someone else is being
harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the owners:

- All: <owners@oddbird.net>
- Carl Meyer: <carl@oddbird.net>
- Jonny Gerig Meyer: <jonny@oddbird.net>
- Miriam Suzanne: <miriam@oddbird.net>

## We strive to:

- **Be welcoming, kind, and helpful**
- **Be collaborative, open, and transparent**
- **Take responsibility for our words and actions**
- **Look out for each other**

When we are in public, our actions determine the public perception of
our company.

## Scope

This document and related procedures apply to behavior occurring inside
or outside the scope of OddBird activities, online or in-person, in
public, at work, in one-on-one communications, and anywhere such
behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being
of OddBird contributors. Any OddBird contributor who violates this code
of conduct may be sanctioned, removed from the team, or expelled from
OddBird community spaces and activities at the discretion of the owners.

If you are being harassed by an OddBird contributor outside our work
environment, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith
reports of harassment by OddBird contributors, especially the owners,
seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces, and harassment
that took place at any point in time. We reserve the right to exclude
people from OddBird spaces and activities based on their past behavior,
including behavior outside OddBird spaces, and behavior towards people
who are not OddBird contributors.

OddBird contributors include owners, contractors, clients, open source
contributors, and anyone participating in OddBird spaces or activities.

## Harassment includes:

- Derogatory, unwelcome, or discriminatory comments related to gender,
  gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
  mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size,
  age, race, or religion.
- Repeated unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices
  and practices, including but not limited to topics like food,
  health, parenting, relationships, geographic locations, drugs, and
  employment.
- Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where
  they are not appropriate.
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual
  descriptions like “`*hug*`” or “`*backrub*`”) without consent or
  after a request to stop.
- Threats of violence.
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging
  a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
- Deliberate intimidation.
- Stalking or following.
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online
  activity for harassment purposes.
- Sustained disruption of discussion.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
- Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without
  their consent – except as necessary to protect vulnerable people
  from intentional abuse.
- Publication of non-harassing private communication.

## Exclusions

OddBird prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged
people’s comfort. The owners will not act on complaints regarding:

- ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and
  ‘cisphobia’
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,”
  “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
- Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive
  behavior or assumptions

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by an OddBird contributor, notice that someone
else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the
owners:

- All: <owners@oddbird.net>
- Carl Meyer: <carl@oddbird.net>
- Jonny Gerig Meyer: <jonny@oddbird.net>
- Miriam Suzanne: <miriam@oddbird.net>

If the person who is harassing you is one of the owners, that owner will
recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as
promptly as we can.

In order to protect this policy from abuse, we reserve the right to
reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports
intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without
response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting
victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about
whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third
parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety
of OddBird contributors or the general public. We will not name
harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences

OddBird contributors asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected
to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior,
the owners may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and
including expulsion from all OddBird spaces and activities, as well as
identification of the participant as a harasser to other OddBird members
or the general public.

The OddBird owners will be happy to help participants contact any
relevant security or law enforcement officials, provide escorts, or
otherwise assist any OddBird contributors experiencing harassment to
feel safe for the duration of their interaction with our company.
