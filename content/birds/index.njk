### Birds Emeritus

Over time,
some OddBirds move on to other work.
We're grateful for the time they spent with us,
and proud of the careers they've built since.

{{ layout.title('Sponsorships & Donations') }}

{% md %}
We are proud to sponsor organizations
that increase diversity in the community --
from race and gender, to identity and sexuality --
and events that bring the whole community together
in thoughtful and inclusive ways.
And then, on occasion, we also sponsor the communities and events
that keep us entertained and fulfilled outside of work.
