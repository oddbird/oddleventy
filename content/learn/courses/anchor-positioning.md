      Just tried out the anchor positioning API in CSS for the first time.
      It's a little more complex than I initially thought it'd be,
      but I love what can be done with it.
      Shout out to @OddBird for the great polyfill too
      so I could get it working in Firefox.

### Troubleshooting tips

Most of the time, CSS anchor positioning just works.
But when it doesn't, it can be a real pain.
I'll share the common issues I've seen and how to avoid them.

{% endcall %}

{% call layout.block('column') %}

### Reduced buggy behavior on dropdowns

What happens to your dropdowns that are close to the edges,
or as the user scrolls?
CSS anchor positioning offers a robust feature set to handle
these literal edge cases.

{% endcall %}

{% call layout.block('column') %}

### Improved page performance

JavaScript positioning libraries require a lot render-blocking
computations to do what they do.
Moving that load to the browser reduces performance bottlenecks.

{% endcall %}

{% call layout.block('column') %}

### Future-proof component libraries

JavaScript positioning libraries require updates and maintenance.
CSS anchor positioning is part of the browser spec,
and will still work in 10 years.

{% endcall %}

{% call layout.block('column') %}

### Using it now

Not all your users have a browser that supports CSS anchor positioning yet.
I'll show you how to use OddBird's anchor position polyfill to support all your users.

{% endcall %}

{% call layout.block('column') %}

### Advanced use cases

The ability to declaratively reference the size and position
of another element unlocks all sorts of creative possibilities.

{% endcall %}

{% endcall %}

{% endcall %}

{{ embed.codepen(
  id='wBvEavV',
  title='Anchor Positioning Demo',
  user='jamessw',
  height=300
) }}

## Why it's time to learn CSS anchor positioning

Anchor positioning is currently not available in all browsers,
and it will be 2 to 3 years before you can safely assume all your users have it.

But now is the time to add this new tool to your toolkit.
The ability to describe anchor positioning in a more
declarative way has changed how I think about layout.
It's unlocked new possibilities and made for better user experiences.

And you can use it now with a polyfill
to make sure that all your users have the same experience.

## Don't add another dependency

While it's tempting to reach for the JavaScript library you've used in the past,
you can instead choose to use the new API. With the polyfill, users with
browsers that support it natively will have a much more performant experience.
And you'll get to enjoy the ergonomics of the new API.

CSS anchor positioning takes a challenging task and simplifies it, speeding up
your delivery time. And while it's not yet in all browsers, it's coming soon,
and available with a polyfill. So now is the perfect time to learn CSS anchor
positioning, step by step, so you can add it to your toolbox.
