### Troubleshooting tips

Most of the time, CSS anchor positioning just works.
But when it doesn't, it can be a real pain.
I'll share the common issues I've seen and how to avoid them.

{% endcall %}

{% call layout.block('column') %}

### Reduced buggy behavior on dropdowns

What happens to your dropdowns that are close to the edges,
or as the user scrolls?
CSS anchor positioning offers a robust feature set to handle
these literal edge cases.

{% endcall %}

{% call layout.block('column') %}

### Improved page performance

JavaScript positioning libraries require a lot render-blocking
computations to do what they do.
Moving that load to the browser reduces performance bottlenecks.

{% endcall %}

{% call layout.block('column') %}

### Future-proof component libraries

JavaScript positioning libraries require updates and maintenance.
CSS anchor positioning is part of the browser spec,
and will still work in 10 years.

{% endcall %}

{% call layout.block('column') %}

### Using it now

Not all your users have a browser that supports CSS anchor positioning yet.
I'll show you how to use OddBird's anchor position polyfill to support all your users.

{% endcall %}

{% call layout.block('column') %}

### Advanced use cases

The ability to declaratively reference the size and position
of another element unlocks all sorts of creative possibilities.

## Why CSS Anchor Positioning Is Important

Recently I was working on a web app with a designer, trying to solve a UX
problem we were encountering near the end of a project. The designer suggested a
tooltip, which was a perfect solution. But we hadn't built that pattern in to
the app yet, and in my head I ran through the cost of setting that up in an
accessible manner. Based on our target browsers, we'd need to research and add a
dependency, style it, and then we'd be able to use a tooltip pattern.

We landed on a different (and probably better) solution, but it still bothered
me that we had to discard a reasonable and common solution solely based on
implementation cost.

What bothered me even more is that I know that there is a solution on the
horizon- we just don't fully have it yet.

CSS anchor positioning takes a challenging task and simplifies it, speeding up
your delivery time. And while it's not yet in all browsers, it's coming soon,
and available with a polyfill. So now is the perfect time to learn CSS anchor
positioning, step by step, so you can add it to your toolbox.
