summary: |
  Helium is a floating browser window that allows you to watch media,
  browse the web, and do much more while you stay productive. Your content
  will never fall behind your other windows even as you switch tasks.
  Helium supports a customizable translucency mode that allows you to
  simultaneously see your content and your work, without intercepting
  mouse clicks when it's translucent. You have the ability to click, drag,
  and scroll behind your floating content.
