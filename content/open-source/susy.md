      My experiments have left me impressed.
      The current state of CSS layout
      means that unless you like to spend a lot of time doing calculations
      something like Susy is really useful.
      The output CSS is pretty much what I'd come up with myself,
      which to me is the acid test for tool use.

summary: |
  **Susy was a responsive layout engine for Sass**,
  before `flexbox` and CSS `grid` were available.
  These days, we recommend letting the browser handle your layouts.
  If you need help moving off Susy,
  or learning the latest in web layout,
  **we offer [training](/services/speaking/)
  and [consulting](/services/development/)
  to help bring you up-to-date**.

## Lightweight & Flexible

Not everyone can play with the latest specs,
and there will always be edge-cases that require manual grid-math.
Susy3 is trimmed down to the most basic features: a lightweight library
of functions that can be used along with `float`, or `flexbox` or any
other CSS -- anywhere, any time.

Susy is also available in the [CodeKit] editor, with 10% of your
purchase going to [Black Girls Code]
when you follow the link from our site.
You can also still access [Susy2 documentation](https://susy.readthedocs.io/)
if necessary.
