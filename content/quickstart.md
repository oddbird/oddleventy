summary: |
  OddBird was founded in 2008 by three siblings --
  [Miriam](/authors/miriam/),
  [Jonny](/authors/jonny/), and
  [Carl](/authors/carl/).
  Since then we've grown to be
  a small team of web contractors
  collaborating on custom web sites,
  applications, and tools.
  This is your guide to working with our team:
  *what we’re offering,
  and what we expect in return*.

## Moving Thoughtfully:

- We strive to help our clients and users
  solve complex problems with technology
  that respects their agency, expertise, and diversity.
- We strive to build a diverse team of experts
  creating sustainable careers together --
  with meaningful work, steady income,
  flexible schedules, and shared profits.
- We strive to keep the company at a size where
  everyone knows each other,
  and there is enough overlap to take vacations
- We strive to choose internal & client projects
  that have a positive impact on the world.
- We strive to be teachers in the industry,
  actively participating in the open-web.

## Our Commitment to You:

We want your time with OddBird to be fun,
challenging, educational, and rewarding.
One of the owners will schedule
a regular check-in with you
to see how things are going,
and help along the way.

### Equal Compensation

- All senior-level contractors
  are paid equally for client work
  (currently \$100/hr – open to change as the team deems necessary)
  across all skillsets.
  Some internal work is paid at lower rates,
  when agreed on by the team.
- If we bring on a junior-level contractor
  they may be temporarily paid $60-$80/hr,
  with a clear path to graduate
  into a senior position.
- Intern compensation
  is determined on a case-by-case basis.

### Transparency

Our books are open to the team,
and the owners will give a financial report
at the beginning of every month.
We will also maintain a yearly spreadsheet
showing the company finances, income, and expenses —
including the hours worked
and pay invoiced by each contractor.

### Consistency

OddBird maintains a “rainy-day” fund
to smooth over the impact
of fluctuations in available client work,
and we aim to keep this fund
at a level sufficient to keep the team working
on internal projects for up to three months
without client work.

### Education & Technology

OddBird provides \$1000 a year
towards continuing education related to your work —
conferences, classes, books, etc.

OddBird also provides \$500 each year
towards technology purchases
that contribute to your daily work.
If unused in a year, this money rolls over
to subsequent years.

These benefits are available
after you’ve been working with OddBird
for at least six months.

### Flexibility

All work is remote,
and all pay is hourly.
You are never required to work more hours
than you are interested and able.
Take a vacation whenever you need,
take the afternoon off to play with your kids,
or work a bit extra to buy yourself a treat.
Just let the team know your schedule in advance,
so we can all adjust as needed.

### Adaptability

If you are interested in learning
aspects of the process that are new and interesting to you
(a designer interested in Python?),
let us know, and we’ll help you get there.
We’re open to adjusting job descriptions,
and even facilitating horizontal movement in the company.

### Participation

We’re a small company,
and everyone has a say in the direction we want to go.
While owners will have final say in major company decisions,
we want the entire team involved in the conversation.

- We have bi-weekly video check-ins
  with the full team
  to discuss what’s working,
  and what might need to change.
- We have “all hands” work retreats
  twice a year,
  for more intensive in-person planning and playing.
  OddBird covers all the costs
  of travel, lodging, and food when we get together —
  and pays a daily rate
  (currently \$400/day)
  during the retreat. (For the safety of our birds and our communities, due to the COVID pandemic our retreats are currently being conducted remotely.)
- We pay for internal OddBird work required to grow the company,
  or improve our processes.
  If you have ideas you’d like to help implement,
  bring a proposal to the team,
  with an estimated budget for the project.
  We’ll try to make it happen!

### Giving Back

Every month,
up to 10% of your invoice to OddBird
can be time spent on open-source contributions,
work-related blogging or book-writing,
and conference talks.
We also contribute regularly to charities
that help improve diversity-in-tech,
and we’re open to your suggestions
on where our money should go.

### Communication

One of the owners will be assigned
to check in with you on a regular basis,
and be available as-needed
for any questions or concerns you might have.
We want to know how things are going for you!

If there are concerns
with your work performance or team interaction,
we will talk with you about them
and give you a chance to correct the problem,
before making a decision
to remove you from the team.
In case of serious misconduct,
you may be removed from the team immediately.

### Safety

OddBird has a comprehensive
[Code of Conduct][coc]
to ensure the comfort and safety
of all our contributors.
We take harassment seriously,
and want to look out for your well-being.

[coc]: /conduct

### Yearly Bonus

End-of-year bonuses
depend on how the company is doing
in a given year.

## Your Commitment to OddBird:

### Communication

OddBird puts a high value on flexibility.
We want the company to fit your life,
not the other way around.
Good communication is required
to make that possible,
but most everything else
is flexible with prior arrangement.
Let us know what you are thinking,
and what you need,
and we’ll work with you to make it possible.

- Let us know when you will be out of the office
  or unavailable,
  so we can plan accordingly.
  We encourage you to take time away from work,
  and turn off notifications while you are out —
  but we also need to plan around your absence.
- Respond to questions in [Slack][slack] and [Trello][trello]
  in a timely fashion.
  Questions may be asked at any time of day or night or weekend
  (so turn off notifications if you don’t want to be disturbed),
  but we only expect participation during our normal working hours
  (see [Scheduling](#scheduling) below).
- Follow the [Code of Conduct][coc] at all times,
  to ensure the safety of all our contributors.
- If you aren’t sure, ask!
  Always err on the side of communicating more.

### Scheduling

While you determine your own work schedule,
we have some basic requests
for availability and overlap with the team.
Here are a few assumptions we’ll make,
unless you arrange something different with us in advance:

- Join our daily “stand-up” video-chat,
  weekdays at 11:30am Eastern Time unless otherwise noted.
- Be available regularly
  in our Slack channels
  between ~11:30am and ~5:00pm Eastern Time on weekdays.
  Even if you are not actively working at the time,
  it’s good to be available for questions
  from other OddBird contributors during these hours.
- Attend the “all-hands” work retreats
  (currently twice a year).
  We understand that not everyone has the same flexibility for travel,
  so we’ll go out of our way to make retreats
  as convenient as possible for everyone involved.
  Let us know if you have any concerns.

If you plan to be unavailable or not working
for a full day or more,
please add your plans as an event on the
OddBird Availability [Google Calendar][gcal].

### Participation

We like to work collaboratively on each feature,
passing responsibility back and forth
so that everyone on the team
has an understanding of the user-story goals,
requirements, and implementation.
It requires active communication
and consistent documentation
to keep everyone up-to-speed.

- All of our work is reviewed
  by another member of the team —
  including UX proposals, designs, code, and copy.
  UX proposals and designs are reviewed before implementation,
  and code is reviewed before it is merged into the main branch.
  Seek out reviews of your work from others on the team,
  be ready to review others’ work,
  and expect to make changes based on a review.
  It’s worth the time to make improvements when we find them.
- Be gracious on either end of a code review.
  We are all working together to improve the quality of our work.
  Discuss the code, not the developer,
  giving feedback honestly and politely.
  Accept critique with an open mind,
  but feel free to push back,
  and provide context for your decisions.
  There is never only one valid solution,
  but a conversation often helps strengthen the final product.
- We rely heavily on [Trello][trello]
  for managing our process across a remote team.
  You can look in Trello
  to find what user stories are available or assigned to you,
  what the priorities are,
  and what others are working on.
  Keep Trello up-to-date as you work,
  so that others can see the status of a story,
  and any relevant conversations and decisions
  that have been made about its implementation.

### Finding Clients

As a small consulting company,
OddBird relies on each of our contributors
to be involved in bringing in new work.
If you are at a conference,
a local tech meetup,
or anywhere else,
we hope that you’ll mention OddBird
(where appropriate)
when introducing yourself,
and keep your eyes and ears open
for clients who could use our services.

### Billing

OddBird pays invoices on a monthly basis,
and sends invoices to clients on the same schedule.

- Track your billable hours
  consistently and accurately
  in the company-provided software
  (currently [Harvest][harvest]).
  Time is “billable”
  when it is spent actively working
  on a client project,
  approved OddBird-internal projects,
  meetings/stand-ups/check-ins,
  or your 10% “giving back” time.
- Submit an hourly invoice,
  itemized by client/project,
  with each line-item rounded up to the nearest half-hour,
  to [accounts@oddbird.net][accounts]
  on the first business day of every month.
  Timely invoices help us bill clients more efficiently.
  If you can’t get your invoice in,
  let the owners know,
  and we can pull your hours from the shared time tracker.
