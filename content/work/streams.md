summary: |
  We worked with Junyo to develop
  an early version of their Streams Resource Library --
  a community-curated directory of teaching materials.
  Teachers can collect and access all of their open and licensed
  digital resources in one library.
  Search by curriculum, student need, use case,
  content efficacy, users, rankings, standards, and other criteria --
  to create custom learning streams.
  OddBird built the initial curation and
  search tools used to populate, annotate, and sort resources.
