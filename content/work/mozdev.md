      @TerribleMia does not only explain “why CSS is how it is”
      but also neatly **summarizes the basic principles
      of what make the Web the Web.**
      If you know those principles,
      many implementation details will be less baffling to you.

  We worked with Mozilla Developer Relations
  to research & address developer needs around
  open web standards, CSS features, accessibility, Firefox,
  and developer tools.
  Over the course of six months,
  we released 30 videos to nearly twenty thousand subscribers.
