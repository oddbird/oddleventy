      Having worked with a handful of web developers,
      OddBird was by far the best, the nicest,

summary: |
  Trop is a cool little lit mag that lives in Los Angeles
  and publishes on the internet.
  They like funny and thought-provoking work of any
  form/genre/medium --
  especially if it does not quite fit in at traditional
  journals or humor sites.
