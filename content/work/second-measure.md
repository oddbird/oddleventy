      OddBird was quick to learn and pick up new technologies.
      **They delivered high quality code, and delivered on time.**

      When the inventor of the modern design system
      names you as **the number one person she'd hire
      to build a design system**, well then I jump!
      I'm grateful she put us in contact.

      **It was easy to talk about technology options.**
      OddBird was both flexible
      (working within the constraints of our existing systems)
      and opinionated
      (bringing context from past experience).

      **I appreciated the specific experience OddBird brought to bear
      in terms of building component libraries**,
      particularly the need to incrementally import the component library
      in order to have it successfully be used.

summary: |
  Second Measure provides a daily view into company performance & consumer
  behavior data. We were hired to help organize the code and design
  systems into a reusable and fully documented React component library and
  integrated design system.
