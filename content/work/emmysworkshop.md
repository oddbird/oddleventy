      The first meeting I had with Miriam helped me decide.
      **She was excited about the project but also realistic**
      about potential issues with the codebase.

      The OddBird team did a great job
      developing the brand for my algebra website
      and revamping the site to reflect both new aesthetics
      and better practices for making it look wonderful
      on a variety of devices.

      I appreciated how professional the team was --
      keeping me informed about the process
      and offering me excellent choices about what direction
      to go at key points.

summary: |
  Emmy's Workshop is part of a research project to improve
  computer-based educational systems.
  Learners can work through an entire problem before receiving feedback.
  Mathematical algorithms analyze how the problem was solved,
  and estimate how well the learner understands
  a variety of mathematical skills.
  Students and faculty built the application
  using Google Web Toolkit --
  then brought us on to help design & implement
  a responsive interface.
