      The first meeting I had with Miriam helped me decide.
      **She was excited about the project but also realistic**
      about potential issues with the codebase.

      The OddBird team did a great job
      developing the brand for my algebra website
      and revamping the site to reflect both new aesthetics
      and better practices for making it look wonderful
      on a variety of devices.

      I appreciated how professional the team was --
      keeping me informed about the process
      and offering me excellent choices about what direction
      to go at key points.

summary: |
  Emmy's Workshop is part of a research project on how to improve
  computer-based educational systems that can accurately diagnoses
  learners' knowledge and recognize what misunderstandings a learner may
  have. In the tutor, learners can work through an entire problem before
  receiving feedback. This simulates the way a learner would work through
  a problem without the computer. Mathematical algorithms analyze how the
  problem was solved, and estimate how well the learner understands a
  variety of mathematical skills. The algorithms are relatively general,
  so they can be applied to a variety of computer-based educational tasks,
  such as games or virtual labs.
