      Working with OddBird was
      **the best outsourcing experience I've ever had.**
      It didn't feel like outsourcing at all.

      **OddBird became an extension of our team**
      bringing UX, frontend, and backend brilliance
      to take MetaDeploy from an idea into a production application.

summary: |
  MetaDeploy helps nonprofit Salesforce admins and developers configure,
  install, and test packaged products -- providing a graphic web interface
  for tasks and flows previously handled in the command-line. Admins can
  select from available products like the Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP) or
  Education Data Architecture (EDA), to install on one of their Salesforce
  organizations. MetaDeploy helps make packages easy to find, while
  allowing users to customize their installations, and run preflight
  checks before committing to a full install.
