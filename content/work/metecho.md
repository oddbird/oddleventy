      Working with OddBird was
      **the best outsourcing experience I've ever had.**
      It didn't feel like outsourcing at all.

      OddBirdâ€™s ability to take feedback and iterate
      on features made it a pleasure to work with
      you all. **The code that was delivered at the
      end of the day was always very clean!**

summary: |
  OddBird collaborated with Salesforce
  to develop a responsive web application
  designed with Lightning Design System
  and its React implementation.
  Metecho makes it easier for people to
  view, test, and contribute to Salesforce Projects
  without learning GitHub.
