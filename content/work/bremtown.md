## Ongoing Partnership

### Daily Collaboration

We continue to work with Bremtown,
responding to their feedback
on new feature development daily.

### Minimal Maintenance

Because the code is resilient
and built with best practices,
maintenance is minimal, allowing us
to spend the majority of our time
on new feature development.

One stylesheet for both sites means
they share the same design tokens,
making them consistent
and much easier to maintain
over time.
