        "html": "<p>Erin <span>&amp;</span> I had a lovely vacation last month,\ndriving around southwest Colorado ‚Äì\nBishop Castle, the Great Sand Dunes,\nChimney Rock, the Durango-Silverton Railroad,\nthe (terrifying) Million Dollar Highway,\nthe Black Canyon of the Gunnison,\nand so on.\nIt was absolutely<span> </span>beautiful.</p>\n<p>This post isn‚Äôt about our vacation,\nor any of the amazing places we<span> </span>visited.</p>\n<p>Every night we would end up in a hotel room,\nwhere we turn on the Food Network\n(back-to-back <em>Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives</em>)\nor whatever is showing on <span>HGTV</span>.\nNested between extensive house remodeling shows,\n<em>No Demo Reno</em> starts with the premise\nthat you can make big upgrades to a home\nwithout moving a single<span> </span>wall.</p>\n<p>This post isn‚Äôt about <span>HGTV</span> or home renovations, either.\nI‚Äôve seen a total of two or three episodes\nwhile knitting, winding down,\nand getting ready for<span> </span>bed.</p>\n<p>But that‚Äôs my goal with this site redesign.\nHow much can I change,\n<em>without moving any of the walls</em>?</p>\n<h2>Some background, and<span> </span>goals</h2>\n<p>I‚Äôve had a number of ‚Äòpersonal‚Äô sites over the years,\nbut landed on this <span>URL</span> in 2015.\nThe first version of this site\nused <a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rstblog\">rstBlog</a> ‚Äì\na small Python static-site generator\nwithout any<span> </span>documentation.</p>\n\n<p>In early 2019,\nI migrated from rstBlog\nonto my current <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">Eleventy</a> setup ‚Äì\na complete overhaul of the site,\ninside and out.\nThe demolition was extensive,\nand I likely\n<a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/06/17/hit-publish/\">broke a few<span> </span>promises</a>.</p>\n<p>This time\nI plan to leave all the\ncontent and Eleventy infrastructure\n<em>basically</em> intact.\nHere are the<span> </span>goals:</p>\n<h3>Clarify the information<span> </span>architecture</h3>\n<p>I‚Äôve always found it hard\nto sort my activities\ninto organized ‚Äòcategories‚Äô,\nso I‚Äôve been treating basically everything\nas an <em>event</em>\nwith the same data, look, and feel.\nSomething happens ‚Äì\na presentation, performance, album release, novel, article, spec ‚Äì\non a particular date,\nwith any number of relevant<span> </span>tags.</p>\n<p>I like some things about that ‚Äì\nembracing the mess of my <span>ADHD</span> life ‚Äì\nbut I haven‚Äôt yet found a great solution\nfor navigating <span>&amp;</span> displaying it.\nPart of the problem is simply that\neverything looks the same.\nIt would help if site visitors\ncan more easily see the different types of content\nreflected in the design and navigation of the<span> </span>site.</p>\n<p>The previous design also relied heavily\non extra-long ‚Äòcalendars‚Äô of content\nat the bottom of every page.\nThat solution felt very bulky to me ‚Äì\nboth in terms of page-load,\nand user scrolling.\nIt may have been\ntechnically <a href=\"https://humanebydesign.com/principles/finite/\">Finite</a>,\nbut it didn‚Äôt always <em>feel</em> as finite\n(or as easy to navigate)\nas I‚Äôd<span> </span>like.</p>\n<h3>Clean up the <span>HTML</span> (&amp;<span> </span>Nunjucks)</h3>\n<p>Technical debt often builds up in <span>HTML</span> over time ‚Äì\nextra wrapping divs, stray classes,\nand other complexities\nthat originate more from style than <em>content</em>.\nIt feels good to clean that out and start fresh.\nSpecifically, I want<span> </span>to:</p>\n<ul><li>Simplify complex Nunjucks<span> </span>templates</li>\n<li>Strip out any <span>HTML</span> that is not absolutely<span> </span>essential</li>\n<li>Improve my use of <a href=\"https://microformats.org/\">microformats</a>\n</li>\n<li>Rethink how <a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/06/04/indiweb/\">WebMentions</a> are<span> </span>displayed</li>\n<li>Rethink how user design customizations are<span> </span>provided</li>\n<li>Always improve accessibility where I<span> </span>can</li>\n</ul><p>I hope to end up with an <span>HTML</span> architecture\nthat feels more minimal ‚Äì\na blank canvas,\nthat I can treat more like a\n<a href=\"http://www.csszengarden.com/\">Zen Garden</a>\nor\n<a href=\"https://stylestage.dev/\">Style Stage</a>\nfor my <span>CSS</span>.\nMy early websites\n(back in the 00s)\nall had multiple\n‚Äò<a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/alternate/\">alternate stylesheets</a>‚Äô\nto choose from,\nand I would love to do that<span> </span>again.</p>\n<h3>Make <span>RSS</span> a first-class part of the<span> </span>site</h3>\n<p>While I was working on WebMentions last month,\nI also made major updates to my <span>RSS</span> feed.\nBut I don‚Äôt love the way browsers\ndisplay a raw xml file.\nDevelopers may be my biggest audience,\nbut they aren‚Äôt my only audience,\nand I want that link to <em>make sense</em>\nand feel like part of the<span> </span>site.</p>\n<p>So I looked into it,\nand it seems like I can\n<a href=\"https://jonchristopher.us/blog/beginning-to-style-your-rss-feed/\">use <span>XSL</span> and <span>CSS</span></a>\nto better design and integrate that page\nas a part of the<span> </span>site.</p>\n<h3>Try out new <span>CSS</span> features<span> </span>(slowly)</h3>\n<p>It‚Äôs been fun\nworking on new <span>CSS</span> features\n<a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/orgs/w3c\">with the <span>CSSWG</span></a>,\nbut now that those features\n(and more)\nare starting to roll out in browsers\nI want to use them on my<span> </span>site.</p>\n<p>Some of features\nare available already,\nor even a few years old.\nThings like\n<code>is()</code> <span>&amp;</span> <code>:where()</code>,\n<code>min()</code>/<code>max()</code> <span>&amp;</span> <code>clamp()</code>,\nvariable fonts,\n<code>color-scheme</code>/<code>accent-color</code>,\nand <a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/02/21/layers-guide/\">Cascade Layers</a>.\nSome of those were already\nbeing used in the old design,\nbut this time I get to design around them from the<span> </span>start.</p>\n<p>Over the next months and years\nI also hope to start playing with\nsize-based container queries <span>&amp;</span> query units,\nscope,\nsubgrid,\n<a href=\"https://lea.verou.me/2020/04/lch-colors-in-css-what-why-and-how/\">new color spaces</a>\n(<code>okLCH</code>/<code>display-P3</code>),\nand more.</p>\n<p>I want to take this slow.\nStart simple,\nand build more interesting themes\nas the various features arrive.\nThat means keeping things simple\nfor as long as possible,\nso it‚Äôs easy

        "text": "Erin & I had a lovely vacation last month,\ndriving around southwest Colorado ‚Äì\nBishop Castle, the Great Sand Dunes,\nChimney Rock, the Durango-Silverton Railroad,\nthe (terrifying) Million Dollar Highway,\nthe Black Canyon of the Gunnison,\nand so on.\nIt was absolutely beautiful.\nThis post isn‚Äôt about our vacation,\nor any of the amazing places we visited.\nEvery night we would end up in a hotel room,\nwhere we turn on the Food Network\n(back-to-back Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives)\nor whatever is showing on HGTV.\nNested between extensive house remodeling shows,\nNo Demo Reno starts with the premise\nthat you can make big upgrades to a home\nwithout moving a single wall.\nThis post isn‚Äôt about HGTV or home renovations, either.\nI‚Äôve seen a total of two or three episodes\nwhile knitting, winding down,\nand getting ready for bed.\nBut that‚Äôs my goal with this site redesign.\nHow much can I change,\nwithout moving any of the walls?\nSome background, and goals\nI‚Äôve had a number of ‚Äòpersonal‚Äô sites over the years,\nbut landed on this URL in 2015.\nThe first version of this site\nused rstBlog ‚Äì\na small Python static-site generator\nwithout any documentation.\n\nIn early 2019,\nI migrated from rstBlog\nonto my current Eleventy setup ‚Äì\na complete overhaul of the site,\ninside and out.\nThe demolition was extensive,\nand I likely\nbroke a few promises.\nThis time\nI plan to leave all the\ncontent and Eleventy infrastructure\nbasically intact.\nHere are the goals:\nClarify the information architecture\nI‚Äôve always found it hard\nto sort my activities\ninto organized ‚Äòcategories‚Äô,\nso I‚Äôve been treating basically everything\nas an event\nwith the same data, look, and feel.\nSomething happens ‚Äì\na presentation, performance, album release, novel, article, spec ‚Äì\non a particular date,\nwith any number of relevant tags.\nI like some things about that ‚Äì\nembracing the mess of my ADHD life ‚Äì\nbut I haven‚Äôt yet found a great solution\nfor navigating & displaying it.\nPart of the problem is simply that\neverything looks the same.\nIt would help if site visitors\ncan more easily see the different types of content\nreflected in the design and navigation of the site.\nThe previous design also relied heavily\non extra-long ‚Äòcalendars‚Äô of content\nat the bottom of every page.\nThat solution felt very bulky to me ‚Äì\nboth in terms of page-load,\nand user scrolling.\nIt may have been\ntechnically Finite,\nbut it didn‚Äôt always feel as finite\n(or as easy to navigate)\nas I‚Äôd like.\nClean up the HTML (& Nunjucks)\nTechnical debt often builds up in HTML over time ‚Äì\nextra wrapping divs, stray classes,\nand other complexities\nthat originate more from style than content.\nIt feels good to clean that out and start fresh.\nSpecifically, I want to:\nSimplify complex Nunjucks templates\nStrip out any HTML that is not absolutely essential\nImprove my use of microformats\n\nRethink how WebMentions are displayed\nRethink how user design customizations are provided\nAlways improve accessibility where I can\nI hope to end up with an HTML architecture\nthat feels more minimal ‚Äì\na blank canvas,\nthat I can treat more like a\nZen Garden\nor\nStyle Stage\nfor my CSS.\nMy early websites\n(back in the 00s)\nall had multiple\n‚Äòalternate stylesheets‚Äô\nto choose from,\nand I would love to do that again.\nMake RSS a first-class part of the site\nWhile I was working on WebMentions last month,\nI also made major updates to my RSS feed.\nBut I don‚Äôt love the way browsers\ndisplay a raw xml file.\nDevelopers may be my biggest audience,\nbut they aren‚Äôt my only audience,\nand I want that link to make sense\nand feel like part of the site.\nSo I looked into it,\nand it seems like I can\nuse XSL and CSS\nto better design and integrate that page\nas a part of the site.\nTry out new CSS features (slowly)\nIt‚Äôs been fun\nworking on new CSS features\nwith the CSSWG,\nbut now that those features\n(and more)\nare starting to roll out in browsers\nI want to use them on my site.\nSome of features\nare available already,\nor even a few years old.\nThings like\nis() & :where(),\nmin()/max() & clamp(),\nvariable fonts,\ncolor-scheme/accent-color,\nand Cascade Layers.\nSome of those were already\nbeing used in the old design,\nbut this time I get to design around them from the start.\nOver the next months and years\nI also hope to start playing with\nsize-based container queries & query units,\nscope,\nsubgrid,\nnew color spaces\n(okLCH/display-P3),\nand more.\nI want to take this slow.\nStart simple,\nand build more interesting themes\nas the various features arrive.\nThat means keeping things simple\nfor as long as possible,\nso it‚Äôs easy to integrate new ideas\nwithout major rewrites.\nHighlight user customizations\nAs part of the previous design,\nI launched\nCascading Color Systems ‚Äì\na tool for giving users\ntotal control over the colors on the site.\nThat was inspired by H√•kon Lie‚Äôs\noriginal 1994 CSS proposal,\nwhich includes the following\ntext-art diagram:\n        User            Author\n Font   o-----x--------------o 64%\n Color  o-x------------------o 90%\n Margin o-------------x------o 37%\n Volume o---------x----------o 50%\n\nI still want to explore that idea\nof making the site design interactive,\nbut I don‚Äôt want to keep relying on\nHSL colors to make it happen.\nFor now, I‚Äôve removed Cascading Colors,\nwhile I rethink the approach.\nI‚Äôd also like to expose the ways\na CSS design is layered ‚Äì\nfrom specified initial values,\nuser agent defaults,\nresets, global typography,\nlayouts, components, etc.\nIt‚Äôs a cascade!\nWhat if users could turn on and off\nthe various Cascade origins,\nand layers\nto see how the site looks\nat different steps of the process?\nCheck out the Theme Settings below,\nfor a first-draft of the idea.\nspec\n  browser\n  reset\n  default\n  theme\n  Try turning CSS layers on and off‚Ä¶\n  These settings are also saved in `localStorage`,\n  so they persist
