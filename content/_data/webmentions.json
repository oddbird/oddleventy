        "text": "Does sticky content harm accessibility? Is it time for a native toggle button on the web? And what makes a good touch target?\nThis week’s Web Weekly includes all the answers and much more!\nBut before we start, if you’ve subscribed to Web Weekly for a while, you might have noticed that I dropped the music picks. And I miss them.\nSo here’s an idea: I’d love to include you and add a section that looks like this:\n[YOUR NAME] listens to \"[BAND] — [Title]\" and says:\n\n\"I just love how bouncy this track is!\"\n\nAre you game? If so, let me know!\nLast week, I shared “Dark Visitors” — a site listing known AI agents. And there are a lot! Knowing about them is good, but what should we do with this info? Do we really need to ship a robots.txt with hundreds of agent definitions to tell them all off?\nPaweł Grzybek thought the same and dreamed of a simple robots.txt convention to “block” AI bots.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this isn’t a thing, but while not the same, I discovered the noml (as in “no machine learning”) specification. It defines a new noml attribute to be used in the robots meta element or X-Robots-Tag HTTP header. That’s a start!\n\n\nWith the three attributes (noindex, nofollow and noml) we could tell Google, that search indexing is cool, but feeding Bard is not. Seems reasonable.\nBut the 100k dollar question remains: does it matter what we put into the robots.txt or robots meta? Will free content not just be sucked in anyways?\nI don’t know, and call me naive… but I want to believe that some rules exist for a reason. ????\n\nAn underrated JS feature — Proxy\n\n\n\nHow often have you used the JS Proxy object? If you’re not a library author, probably not that often. I haven’t used it much either, but I’m amazed every time I see it. James Stuckey Weber described handling state and side effects with vanilla JS. ????\nKeep state\n\n\nEven though I’ve read Matt Pocock’s guide explaining the difference of type and interface ten times by now, it doesn’t stick. ????\nWhy is this confusing stumble stone part of TypeScript?\nThe answer: interface is somewhat tech debt, and now we can’t get rid of it. Surprise! It turns out, that designing a language is tough!\nWhy do we have both?\n\nNext.js mistakes and tricks\n\nI’ll leave two links for the Next.js devs here today…\n\n\n☝️ Granted, this is total clickbait. And I couldn’t resist it myself. ???? But the post delivered big times.\n\n\nFrom Vercel itself, Lee Robinson shared some common mistakes with the new App router. The article is worth peaking at if you’re already part of the app router crew.\n\nThe wonderful weird web – “interesting clocks”\n\n\n\nI’m such a pudding.cool fanboy. This week, I discovered the “clocks project”. What’s special about it?\nThe clocks take the current time and show\nhow often it was mentioned in a song\nhow often it was mentioned on YouTube\nhow often it made news headlines\ncities with a population matching it.\nI love this!\nWatch the time\n\nWhat are your favorite internet corners? Send them my way, and I’ll include them in Web Weekly!\n\n\nWhere should the init code go in a web component?\n\n\n\nWhen creating a new web component, putting all the init code into the constructor is tempting. But there are better approaches than that. Nolan Lawson explains why.\nStructure your components correctly\n\nSpeaking of web components…\n\n\n\nMayank shared how a 38 LOC base class allows you to write custom elements like this. ☝️ It has a static register method, event delegation and straightforward element querying.\nAre they creating a new web component framework here? ????\nEase custom elements\n\nThe problem with sticky content\n\n\n\nDoug Abrams shared interface patterns that violate the WCAG 1.4.10 Reflow criterion. The problems are based on sticky content, overflowing text and popups.\nWhile explaining the issues, Doug shares a valid, overlooked point. When developing for mobile, we constantly resize our viewports and change the width, but most people (myself included) stay in portrait mode.\nWhat happens to the sticky bar when there’s very little vertical space?\nMake things accessible\n\nWowza! You’re halfway through.\nWould you enjoy getting Web Weekly straight to your inbox?\n\n\n\nIf you read one thing in this Web Weekly, this is it. Ahmad Shadeed created a reference piece on touch targets. It includes interactive demos, videos and tons of references.\nMake yourself comfortable because this article is long. Very long, but worth it!\nBuild great UI\n\nRandom MDN – valid a element attributes\n\n\n\nFrom the unlimited MDN knowledge archive…\nMDN lists eight valid anchor element attributes. Sure, href is one, but can you name the others?\nLearn more about links\nping is my favorite. ????\n\nTIL recap – input.labels\n\n\n\nHere’s some DOM trivia: did you know that input elements hold references to their labels? If not, now you do!\nAccess the labels\n\nNew on the platform — switch\n\n\nI have yet to look into it, but check this! Apple has been experimenting with a native toggle switch since Safari Tech Preview 185. Discussions about the feature are happening on GitHub as we speak.\nIs a native toggle a good idea, though?\nMany people mentioned that toggles are misleading and confusing. If you consider the state of the web, that’s a fair argument. The toggles have different colors, shapes, direction and sometimes come with wild ideas.\nBut I’m not concerned about this point because I believe that if there’s one native toggle, we will internalize what’s ON and OFF very quickly. Let’s see! ????\n\nThree valuable projects to have a look at\n\n\n\nIf you’re looking for a quick way to debug webhooks, webhook.cool has the coolest smiley out there and gives out unlimited debug URLs for free.\nDebug your ????s\nThis week’s wise words come from Flavio. ????\n\n\nIf I have to create an entire castle in my head to understand how things work, it’s not going to be a healthy relationship between me and that tool.\n\n\nLoved this email? Hated this email? I want to hear about it!\nIf you think there’s something that needs to be improved or something that you enjoyed, reply to this email because I want to know more!\nAnd with that, take care of yourself – mentally, physically, and emotionally.\nI’ll see you next week! ????"

</span>bed.</p>\n<p>But that’s my goal with this site redesign.\nHow much can I change,\n<em>without moving any of the walls</em>?</p>\n<h2>Some background, and<span> </span>goals</h2>\n<p>I’ve had a number of ‘personal’ sites over the years,\nbut landed on this <span>URL</span> in 2015.\nThe first version of this site\nused <a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rstblog\">rstBlog</a> –\na small Python static-site generator\nwithout any<span> </span>documentation.</p>\n\n<p>In early 2019,\nI migrated from rstBlog\nonto my current <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">Eleventy</a> setup –\na complete overhaul of the site,\ninside and out.\nThe demolition was extensive,\nand I likely\n<a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/06/17/hit-publish/\">broke a few<span> </span>promises</a>.</p>\n<p>This time\nI plan to leave all the\ncontent and Eleventy infrastructure\n<em>basically</em> intact.\nHere are the<span> </span>goals:</p>\n<h3>Clarify the information<span> </span>architecture</h3>\n<p>I’ve always found it hard\nto sort my activities\ninto organized ‘categories’,\nso I’ve been treating basically everything\nas an <em>event</em>\nwith the same data, look, and feel.\nSomething happens –\na presentation, performance, album release, novel, article, spec –\non a particular date,\nwith any number of relevant<span> </span>tags.</p>\n<p>I like some things about that –\nembracing the mess of my <span>ADHD</span> life –\nbut I haven’t yet found a great solution\nfor navigating <span>&amp;</span> displaying it.\nPart of the problem is simply that\neverything looks the same.\nIt would help if site visitors\ncan more easily see the different types of content\nreflected in the design and navigation of the<span> </span>site.</p>\n<p>The previous design also relied heavily\non extra-long ‘calendars’ of content\nat the bottom of every page.\nThat solution felt very bulky to me –\nboth in terms of page-load,\nand user scrolling.\nIt may have been\ntechnically <a href=\"https://humanebydesign.com/principles/finite/\">Finite</a>,\nbut it didn’t always <em>feel</em> as finite\n(or as easy to navigate)\nas I’d<span> </span>like.</p>\n<h3>Clean up the <span>HTML</span> (&amp;<span> </span>Nunjucks)</h3>\n<p>Technical debt often builds up in <span>HTML</span> over time –\nextra wrapping divs, stray classes,\nand other complexities\nthat originate more from style than <em>content</em>.\nIt feels good to clean that out and start fresh.\nSpecifically, I want<span> </span>to:</p>\n<ul><li>Simplify complex Nunjucks<span> </span>templates</li>\n<li>Strip out any <span>HTML</span> that is not absolutely<span> </span>essential</li>\n<li>Improve my use of <a href=\"https://microformats.org/\">microformats</a>\n</li>\n<li>Rethink how <a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/06/04/indiweb/\">WebMentions</a> are<span> </span>displayed</li>\n<li>Rethink how user design customizations are<span> </span>provided</li>\n<li>Always improve accessibility where I<span> </span>can</li>\n</ul><p>I hope to end up with an <span>HTML</span> architecture\nthat feels more minimal –\na blank canvas,\nthat I can treat more like a\n<a href=\"http://www.csszengarden.com/\">Zen Garden</a>\nor\n<a href=\"https://stylestage.dev/\">Style Stage</a>\nfor my <span>CSS</span>.\nMy early websites\n(back in the 00s)\nall had multiple\n‘<a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/alternate/\">alternate stylesheets</a>’\nto choose from,\nand I would love to do that<span> </span>again.</p>\n<h3>Make <span>RSS</span> a first-class part of the<span> </span>site</h3>\n<p>While I was working on WebMentions last month,\nI also made major updates to my <span>RSS</span> feed.\nBut I don’t love the way browsers\ndisplay a raw xml file.\nDevelopers may be my biggest audience,\nbut they aren’t my only audience,\nand I want that link to <em>make sense</em>\nand feel like part of the<span> </span>site.</p>\n<p>So I looked into it,\nand it seems like I can\n<a href=\"https://jonchristopher.us/blog/beginning-to-style-your-rss-feed/\">use <span>XSL</span> and <span>CSS</span></a>\nto better design and integrate that page\nas a part of the<span> </span>site.</p>\n<h3>Try out new <span>CSS</span> features<span> </span>(slowly)</h3>\n<p>It’s been fun\nworking on new <span>CSS</span> features\n<a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/orgs/w3c\">with the <span>CSSWG</span></a>,\nbut now that those features\n(and more)\nare starting to roll out in browsers\nI want to use them on my<span> </span>site.</p>\n<p>Some of features\nare available already,\nor even a few years old.\nThings like\n<code>is()</code> <span>&amp;</span> <code>:where()</code>,\n<code>min()</code>/<code>max()</code> <span>&amp;</span> <code>clamp()</code>,\nvariable fonts,\n<code>color-scheme</code>/<code>accent-color</code>,\nand <a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/02/21/layers-guide/\">Cascade Layers</a>.\nSome of those were already\nbeing used in the old design,\nbut this time I get to design around them from the<span> </span>start.</p>\n<p>Over the next months and years\nI also hope to start playing with\nsize-based container queries <span>&amp;</span> query units,\nscope,\nsubgrid,\n<a href=\"https://lea.verou.me/2020/04/lch-colors-in-css-what-why-and-how/\">new color spaces</a>\n(<code>okLCH</code>/<code>display-P3</code>),\nand more.</p>\n<p>I want to take this slow.\nStart simple,\nand build more interesting themes\nas the various features arrive.\nThat means keeping things simple\nfor as long as possible,\nso it’s easy to integrate new ideas\nwithout major<span> </span>rewrites.</p>\n<h3>Highlight user customizations</h3>\n<p>As part of the previous design,\nI launched\n<a href=\"https://www.oddbird.net/cascading-colors/\">Cascading Color Systems</a> –\na tool for giving users\ntotal control over the colors on the site.\nThat was inspired by Håkon Lie’s\n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html\">original 1994 <span>CSS</span> proposal</a>,\nwhich includes the following\ntext-art<span> </span>diagram:</p>\n<pre><code>        User            Author\n Font   o-----x--------------o 64%\n Color  o-x------------------o 90%\n Margin o-------------x------o 37%\n Volume o---------x----------o 50%\n</code></pre>\n<p>I still want to explore that idea\nof making the site design interactive,\nbut I don’t want to keep relying on\n<span>HSL</span> colors to make it happen.\nFor now, I’ve removed Cascading Colors,\nwhile I rethink the<span> </span>approach.</p>\n<p>I’d also like to expose the ways\na <span>CSS</span> design is <em>layered</em> –\nfrom specified initial values,\n<a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/07/04/body-margin-8px/\">user agent defaults</a>,\nresets, global typography,\nlayouts, components, etc.\n<em>It’s a cascade!</em>\nWhat if users could turn on and off\nthe various Cascade <em>origins</em>,\nand <em>layers</em>\nto see how the site looks\nat different steps of the process?\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/08/07/minimal/#settings\">Theme Settings</a> below,\nfor a first-draft of the<span> </span>idea.</p>\nspec\n  browser\n  reset\n  default\n  theme\n  Try turning <span>CSS</span> layers on and off…\n  These settings are also saved in `localStorage`,\n  so they persist across visits.\n<p>This idea is absolutely\ninspired by the personal site of\n<a href=\"https://ichimnetz.com/\">Nils Binder</a>.\nNils provides a slider from 0 to 865 lines of <span>CSS</span>,\nwith animated transitions between the styles.\nIt’s a lot of fun,\nand I recommend checking it<span> </span>out.</p>\n<h2>The order of<span> </span>things</h2>\n<p>My instinct was to strip out all <span>CSS</span>,\nand then work on getting the <span>HTML</span> cleaned up\nwhile my site remains ‘naked’ of style.\nI didn’t quite do that,\nbut I’m aiming for something close.\nHere’s what I’ve done so<span> </span>far:</p>\n<ul><li>Remove the old <span>CSS</span><span> </span>(done)</li>\n<li>Begin re-arranging the <span>HTML</span> <span>&amp;</span> Nunjucks<span> </span>templates</li>\n<li>\n<code>@layer reset</code> »\njust the bare minimum needed\nfor <span>HTML</span> tags and attributes to work the way I expect,\nstarting from <a href=\"https://github.com/jensimmons/cssremedy\"><span>CSS</span><span> </span>Remedy</a>.</li>\n<li>\n<code>@layer default</code> »\njust enough colors <span>&amp;</span> typography\nto make the site feel usable to me,\nwithout making decisions about\nhow I’m going to theme it<span> </span>long-term.</li>\n<li>\n<code>@layer theme</code> »\nadds a few site-specific features and opinions\non top of the typographic<span> </span>defaults.</li>\n</ul><p>The distinction between layers is still fluid,\nas I try to figure out what I’m doing.\nI’ll keep adjusting the <code>reset</code> and <code>default</code> styles as I go,\nbut hope to leave the <code>theme</code> layer\nas minimal as possible,\nwhile I focus on the architectural<span> </span>issues.</p>\n<p>For now,\nthe <code>default</code> layer has colors based roughly on Firefox\n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#css-system-colors\"><span>CSS</span> System Colors</a>.\nI experimented briefly with using\nthe System Colors directly,\nbut support seems a bit inconsistent,\nand there are additional accessibility considerations\nwith that approach.\nI might revisit in the<span> </span>future.</p>\n<p>The <code>theme</code> layer colors\nare based on <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#named-colors\">Named Colors</a>,\nwith some minor adjustments for accessible contrast.\nWhile\n<code>darkslategray</code></p>\n<p>works fine as a text <code>color</code>\nover\n<code>azure</code></p>\n<p>in <code>light</code> mode,\nI used Sass to darken it\nas a <code>background-color</code> in <code>dark</code> mode,\nproviding enough contrast for my accent colors as well.\nThe result is\n<code>hsl(180deg 25% 6%)</code>\n.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot more to do.\nWebMentions are temporarily hidden,\n<span>RSS</span> isn’t highlighted in the nav or styled,\nand all content still looks the same in a list –\nbut I have to start somewhere.\nWe’ll see where it goes<span> </span>(slowly).</p>\n<h2>Some links I’ve been keeping open while I<span>

more.\nI want to take this slow.\nStart simple,\nand build more interesting themes\nas the various features arrive.\nThat means keeping things simple\nfor as long as possible,\nso it’s easy to integrate new ideas\nwithout major rewrites.\nHighlight user customizations\nAs part of the previous design,\nI launched\nCascading Color Systems –\na tool for giving users\ntotal control over the colors on the site.\nThat was inspired by Håkon Lie’s\noriginal 1994 CSS proposal,\nwhich includes the following\ntext-art diagram:\n        User            Author\n Font   o-----x--------------o 64%\n Color  o-x------------------o 90%\n Margin o-------------x------o 37%\n Volume o---------x----------o 50%\n\nI still want to explore that idea\nof making the site design interactive,\nbut I don’t want to keep relying on\nHSL colors to make it happen.\nFor now, I’ve removed Cascading Colors,\nwhile I rethink the approach.\nI’d also like to expose the ways\na CSS design is layered –\nfrom specified initial values,\nuser agent defaults,\nresets, global typography,\nlayouts, components, etc.\nIt’s a cascade!\nWhat if users could turn on and off\nthe various Cascade origins,\nand layers\nto see how the site looks\nat different steps of the process?\nCheck out the Theme Settings below,\nfor a first-draft of the idea.\nspec\n  browser\n  reset\n  default\n  theme\n  Try turning CSS layers on and off…\n  These settings are also saved in `localStorage`,\n  so they persist across visits.\nThis idea is absolutely\ninspired by the personal site of\nNils Binder.\nNils provides a slider from 0 to 865 lines of CSS,\nwith animated transitions between the styles.\nIt’s a lot of fun,\nand I recommend checking it out.\nThe order of things\nMy instinct was to strip out all CSS,\nand then work on getting the HTML cleaned up\nwhile my site remains ‘naked’ of style.\nI didn’t quite do that,\nbut I’m aiming for something close.\nHere’s what I’ve done so far:\nRemove the old CSS (done)\nBegin re-arranging the HTML & Nunjucks templates\n\n@layer reset »\njust the bare minimum needed\nfor HTML tags and attributes to work the way I expect,\nstarting from CSS Remedy.\n\n@layer default »\njust enough colors & typography\nto make the site feel usable to me,\nwithout making decisions about\nhow I’m going to theme it long-term.\n\n@layer theme »\nadds a few site-specific features and opinions\non top of the typographic defaults.\nThe distinction between layers is still fluid,\nas I try to figure out what I’m doing.\nI’ll keep adjusting the reset and default styles as I go,\nbut hope to leave the theme layer\nas minimal as possible,\nwhile I focus on the architectural issues.\nFor now,\nthe default layer has colors based roughly on Firefox\nCSS System Colors.\nI experimented briefly with using\nthe System Colors directly,\nbut support seems a bit inconsistent,\nand there are additional accessibility considerations\nwith that approach.\nI might revisit in the future.\nThe theme layer colors\nare based on Named Colors,\nwith some minor adjustments for accessible contrast.\nWhile\ndarkslategray\nworks fine as a text color\nover\nazure\nin light mode,\nI used Sass to darken it\nas a background-color in dark mode,\nproviding enough contrast for my accent colors as well.\nThe result is\nhsl(180deg 25% 6%)\n.\nThere’s a lot more to do.\nWebMentions are temporarily hidden,\nRSS isn’t highlighted in the nav or styled,\nand all content still looks the same in a list –\nbut I have to start somewhere.\nWe’ll see where it goes (slowly).\nSome links I’ve been keeping open while I work\nArticles:\n\nThe Smallest CSS\nby Robin Rendle\n\n\nStyle with Stateful, Semantic Selectors\nby Ben Myers (with links to several others)\n\nBeginning to Style Your RSS Feed\nby Jon Christopher\n\nSites:\n\ntink\n(Léonie did a lovely redesign recently, with tags for navigation)\nIndieWebify.Me\nmicroformats\nHumane by Design\nSorted Colors\nContrast Ratio"
