        "text": "Every day, I share on Twitter and LinkedIn a list of curated articles I read, resources and tools about UX Design, User Research, UI and mobile design, HTML, CSS, the web industry, some process, some inspiration, etc. This is an archive of everything I shared this week.\n#Now – what I’m up to\nThis week I talked at Web Aim Conference and I updated my talk, slides, and also article on how, what and why designers can document accessibility. I added some details based on previous feedback, and I also prepared a checklist to help people document: A Designer’s Guide to Documenting Accessibility & User Interactions\nWanna hear me rant about UX recruitment but also give a few good tips to navigate the mess? Here you go: Episode 121: The UX Job Hiring and Seeking Landscape, Part 4 with Stéphanie Walter (on apple Podcast, Google podcast and Spotify)\n\nI found some purple and yellow cauliflowers, so I started a new batch of pickled cauliflowers that match my visual identity. How cool is that?\nTL;DNR the one you should not miss\n#Cognitive Biases\nIf you are interesting in how human take decisions, here is a nice list of difference cognitive biases explained with some examples and illustrations: Biases by decision lab.\nInteresting article\n#Accessibility\nIf you have a mac, here are some great tips to help you test sites using the VoiceOver Screen Reader: Mac VoiceOver Testing the Simple Way\n\n\nThe First Steps to Breaking into Digital Accessibility Careers, by Louise Clark. A great article on the need to gain more awareness around the topic of accessibility, in the community but also in dev and design schools!\n\nVisit for a surprise: Eric Bailey turned a conversation we had about easter eggs and accessibility into a very interesting article. Could spoiling a joke be an accessibility issue? You better believe it. Also, did you find the easter egg on my homepage yet?\n#Color\n“Psychedelic Dinosaurs, Four-Dimensional Hummingbirds, and How We Got Our Vision: Color, Consciousness, and the Dazzling Universe of Tetrachromacy” an beautiful article on color perception in the animal and human world.\n#Agile\n“MVP” – the most misused term in tech. A much better definition of Minimum Viable Product is the version of the product that helps you test your most critical assumption. It is NOT: bad design, bad code, something that could harm the company’s reputation\n#Information Architecture\nKnowledge structures: many structured ways of knowing seem to roughly fall into one of several spatial structures: lists, trees, grids, and networks.\n#Design\nInteresting article on how we use objects and metaphors to help users understand our interfaces: Design with materials, not features\n#Behavioral Psychology\n“How Uber Used Psychology to Manipulate Its Drivers” outch, that is, quite bad and even dangerous at some point we are talking about manipulating people who might be tired into driving more hours!\n#Offboarding\nWait, according to this case study, Typeform forces you to fill a mandatory survey if you want to downgrade your plan? This is one of the worse shady pattern I’ve ever seen. I understand it can be interesting to know why, but, mandatory???\n#Organization\nHow to Avoid Misplacing Things? Easy: put them where you’re likely to find them later, because, “out of sight, out of mind”. Also applies to interfaces ^^\nInspiration, fun experiments and great ideas\n#Maps\n\nHere is a cute map of most common dreams by countries. I’m not sure I trust dream meanings, but I am glad I am not the only dreaming about fallen teeth. There is no school related stuff in here though, I am alone? Like “I attend my class because I could not find the schedule. Also I missed some classes and can’t find anyone to share the notes. Wait, I already have a master degree, why do I even care” kind of dream? Also to be clear: this data is absolutely not scientific, it’s based on an analysis of google search data, so there’s a sample bias here. But I’m still super curious and I love how they presented it, because I’m a map and dataviz geek.\n\nWondering what a google map’s street view version of Zelda Breath of the Wild would look like?\n#Typography\nTypehunting: some simple things make me happy. Beautiful typography on old labels and objects is one of them\n#UI Inspiration\nIn case you need a little bit of inspiration: 37 Easy Ways to Spice Up Your UI Designs.

Although many contemporary CSS frameworks provide robust cross browser compatibility compatibility, a developer must always evaluate the front-functionality end’s and conduct different tests to guarantee that cross browser compatibility issues do not occur.  Additionally, you may optimise your development process by doing responsive testing on your project following CSS installation."

</span>bed.</p>\n<p>But that’s my goal with this site redesign.\nHow much can I change,\n<em>without moving any of the walls</em>?</p>\n<h2>Some background, and<span> </span>goals</h2>\n<p>I’ve had a number of ‘personal’ sites over the years,\nbut landed on this <span>URL</span> in 2015.\nThe first version of this site\nused <a href=\"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rstblog\">rstBlog</a> –\na small Python static-site generator\nwithout any<span> </span>documentation.</p>\n\n<p>In early 2019,\nI migrated from rstBlog\nonto my current <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">Eleventy</a> setup –\na complete overhaul of the site,\ninside and out.\nThe demolition was extensive,\nand I likely\n<a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/06/17/hit-publish/\">broke a few<span> </span>promises</a>.</p>\n<p>This time\nI plan to leave all the\ncontent and Eleventy infrastructure\n<em>basically</em> intact.\nHere are the<span> </span>goals:</p>\n<h3>Clarify the information<span> </span>architecture</h3>\n<p>I’ve always found it hard\nto sort my activities\ninto organized ‘categories’,\nso I’ve been treating basically everything\nas an <em>event</em>\nwith the same data, look, and feel.\nSomething happens –\na presentation, performance, album release, novel, article, spec –\non a particular date,\nwith any number of relevant<span> </span>tags.</p>\n<p>I like some things about that –\nembracing the mess of my <span>ADHD</span> life –\nbut I haven’t yet found a great solution\nfor navigating <span>&amp;</span> displaying it.\nPart of the problem is simply that\neverything looks the same.\nIt would help if site visitors\ncan more easily see the different types of content\nreflected in the design and navigation of the<span> </span>site.</p>\n<p>The previous design also relied heavily\non extra-long ‘calendars’ of content\nat the bottom of every page.\nThat solution felt very bulky to me –\nboth in terms of page-load,\nand user scrolling.\nIt may have been\ntechnically <a href=\"https://humanebydesign.com/principles/finite/\">Finite</a>,\nbut it didn’t always <em>feel</em> as finite\n(or as easy to navigate)\nas I’d<span> </span>like.</p>\n<h3>Clean up the <span>HTML</span> (&amp;<span> </span>Nunjucks)</h3>\n<p>Technical debt often builds up in <span>HTML</span> over time –\nextra wrapping divs, stray classes,\nand other complexities\nthat originate more from style than <em>content</em>.\nIt feels good to clean that out and start fresh.\nSpecifically, I want<span> </span>to:</p>\n<ul><li>Simplify complex Nunjucks<span> </span>templates</li>\n<li>Strip out any <span>HTML</span> that is not absolutely<span> </span>essential</li>\n<li>Improve my use of <a href=\"https://microformats.org/\">microformats</a>\n</li>\n<li>Rethink how <a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/06/04/indiweb/\">WebMentions</a> are<span> </span>displayed</li>\n<li>Rethink how user design customizations are<span> </span>provided</li>\n<li>Always improve accessibility where I<span> </span>can</li>\n</ul><p>I hope to end up with an <span>HTML</span> architecture\nthat feels more minimal –\na blank canvas,\nthat I can treat more like a\n<a href=\"http://www.csszengarden.com/\">Zen Garden</a>\nor\n<a href=\"https://stylestage.dev/\">Style Stage</a>\nfor my <span>CSS</span>.\nMy early websites\n(back in the 00s)\nall had multiple\n‘<a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/alternate/\">alternate stylesheets</a>’\nto choose from,\nand I would love to do that<span> </span>again.</p>\n<h3>Make <span>RSS</span> a first-class part of the<span> </span>site</h3>\n<p>While I was working on WebMentions last month,\nI also made major updates to my <span>RSS</span> feed.\nBut I don’t love the way browsers\ndisplay a raw xml file.\nDevelopers may be my biggest audience,\nbut they aren’t my only audience,\nand I want that link to <em>make sense</em>\nand feel like part of the<span> </span>site.</p>\n<p>So I looked into it,\nand it seems like I can\n<a href=\"https://jonchristopher.us/blog/beginning-to-style-your-rss-feed/\">use <span>XSL</span> and <span>CSS</span></a>\nto better design and integrate that page\nas a part of the<span> </span>site.</p>\n<h3>Try out new <span>CSS</span> features<span> </span>(slowly)</h3>\n<p>It’s been fun\nworking on new <span>CSS</span> features\n<a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/orgs/w3c\">with the <span>CSSWG</span></a>,\nbut now that those features\n(and more)\nare starting to roll out in browsers\nI want to use them on my<span> </span>site.</p>\n<p>Some of features\nare available already,\nor even a few years old.\nThings like\n<code>is()</code> <span>&amp;</span> <code>:where()</code>,\n<code>min()</code>/<code>max()</code> <span>&amp;</span> <code>clamp()</code>,\nvariable fonts,\n<code>color-scheme</code>/<code>accent-color</code>,\nand <a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/02/21/layers-guide/\">Cascade Layers</a>.\nSome of those were already\nbeing used in the old design,\nbut this time I get to design around them from the<span> </span>start.</p>\n<p>Over the next months and years\nI also hope to start playing with\nsize-based container queries <span>&amp;</span> query units,\nscope,\nsubgrid,\n<a href=\"https://lea.verou.me/2020/04/lch-colors-in-css-what-why-and-how/\">new color spaces</a>\n(<code>okLCH</code>/<code>display-P3</code>),\nand more.</p>\n<p>I want to take this slow.\nStart simple,\nand build more interesting themes\nas the various features arrive.\nThat means keeping things simple\nfor as long as possible,\nso it’s easy to integrate new ideas\nwithout major<span> </span>rewrites.</p>\n<h3>Highlight user customizations</h3>\n<p>As part of the previous design,\nI launched\n<a href=\"https://www.oddbird.net/cascading-colors/\">Cascading Color Systems</a> –\na tool for giving users\ntotal control over the colors on the site.\nThat was inspired by Håkon Lie’s\n<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html\">original 1994 <span>CSS</span> proposal</a>,\nwhich includes the following\ntext-art<span> </span>diagram:</p>\n<pre><code>        User            Author\n Font   o-----x--------------o 64%\n Color  o-x------------------o 90%\n Margin o-------------x------o 37%\n Volume o---------x----------o 50%\n</code></pre>\n<p>I still want to explore that idea\nof making the site design interactive,\nbut I don’t want to keep relying on\n<span>HSL</span> colors to make it happen.\nFor now, I’ve removed Cascading Colors,\nwhile I rethink the<span> </span>approach.</p>\n<p>I’d also like to expose the ways\na <span>CSS</span> design is <em>layered</em> –\nfrom specified initial values,\n<a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/07/04/body-margin-8px/\">user agent defaults</a>,\nresets, global typography,\nlayouts, components, etc.\n<em>It’s a cascade!</em>\nWhat if users could turn on and off\nthe various Cascade <em>origins</em>,\nand <em>layers</em>\nto see how the site looks\nat different steps of the process?\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/08/07/minimal/#settings\">Theme Settings</a> below,\nfor a first-draft of the<span> </span>idea.</p>\nspec\n  browser\n  reset\n  default\n  theme\n  Try turning <span>CSS</span> layers on and off…\n  These settings are also saved in `localStorage`,\n  so they persist across visits.\n<p>This idea is absolutely\ninspired by the personal site of\n<a href=\"https://ichimnetz.com/\">Nils Binder</a>.\nNils provides a slider from 0 to 865 lines of <span>CSS</span>,\nwith animated transitions between the styles.\nIt’s a lot of fun,\nand I recommend checking it<span> </span>out.</p>\n<h2>The order of<span> </span>things</h2>\n<p>My instinct was to strip out all <span>CSS</span>,\nand then work on getting the <span>HTML</span> cleaned up\nwhile my site remains ‘naked’ of style.\nI didn’t quite do that,\nbut I’m aiming for something close.\nHere’s what I’ve done so<span> </span>far:</p>\n<ul><li>Remove the old <span>CSS</span><span> </span>(done)</li>\n<li>Begin re-arranging the <span>HTML</span> <span>&amp;</span> Nunjucks<span> </span>templates</li>\n<li>\n<code>@layer reset</code> »\njust the bare minimum needed\nfor <span>HTML</span> tags and attributes to work the way I expect,\nstarting from <a href=\"https://github.com/jensimmons/cssremedy\"><span>CSS</span><span> </span>Remedy</a>.</li>\n<li>\n<code>@layer

is still fluid,\nas I try to figure out what I’m doing.\nI’ll keep adjusting the <code>reset</code> and <code>default</code> styles as I go,\nbut hope to leave the <code>theme</code> layer\nas minimal as possible,\nwhile I focus on the architectural<span> </span>issues.</p>\n<p>For now,\nthe <code>default</code> layer has colors based roughly on Firefox\n<a
