summary: |
  **OddBird stands with the Black community
  in grieving and protesting racist police violence and murder.**
  We must all demand an end to the
  state-sanctioned assault on Black people,
  and take action to confront anti-Blackness in all our systems.
  There is much to do, but one action is simple and clear:
  we want to support the organizations
  already working in the streets and behind the scenes --
  and **we're inviting you to join us**.

## Neutrality is Not an Option

We understand that software is political, tech is complicit, and
anti-Blackness is systemic to our nation and our industry. We'll
continue to fight for diversity & inclusion in our communities, in our
work, and in our own company -- from training & hiring, to equal pay,
speaking opportunities, mentorship, decision-making, and shared
ownership.

**We are not neutral.**
